Yo neighbors. I saw a guy in a fresh Bosa jersey waiting in line for 45 minutes at the NFL Shop tent near Gate A just to buy a hat. Don't be that guy.

The "Official Super Bowl Shop" at the stadium is a tourist trap designed to separate you from your wallet as efficiently as possible.

## The "Event Pricing" Reality
Here is what they don't tell you: The prices inside the security perimeter are often higher than the MSRP you see online. It's "Event Pricing." That $130 jersey can jump to $160 just because it's being sold on stadium grounds. Plus, you are paying the Santa Clara sales tax (9.125%).

## The Inventory Crisis
By Friday afternoon, the stadium store is already picked over. The common sizes (L, XL) are the first to go. You end up settling for a XXL that fits like a tent or a Medium that cuts off your circulation.

## The Local Play: Milpitas
If you have a car, drive 15 minutes east to the **Great Mall in Milpitas**.
There is a massive Dick's Sporting Goods and several athletic chains. They have the exact same "Super Bowl LX" licensed gear.
*   **No line:** You walk right in.
*   **Standard Pricing:** You pay the sticker price, not the event price.
*   **Stock:** They restock daily from the warehouse, unlike the stadium tents which rely on specific drop shipments.

## The "Bootleg" Bridge
If you don't care about the holographic sticker, the pedestrian bridges over Highway 101 (specifically the one at Cedar Blvd) are the epicenter of the gray market. You'll find vendors selling "San Francisco 2026" shirts for $20 cash.
*Warning:* The quality varies. Wash it once, and it might shrink into a crop top. But for a one-day event? It beats paying $50 for a t-shirt inside.

## The Airport Warning
Whatever you do, do not buy gear at SFO or SJC on your way out. The airport markup makes the stadium look like a discount bin.
