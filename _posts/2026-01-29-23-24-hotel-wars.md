I'm hearing whispers of a standoff between league officials and team logistics directors, and it has nothing to do with practice fields.

It's about the bus ride.

Usually, the downtown San Francisco hotels are the prize. The Palace, the Marriott Marquis, the views, the prestige. Teams fight for the "City" assignment.

**Not this year.**

**Sources confirm** that two playoff contenders have already signaled they will **decline** the designated "Team A" hotel in Union Square if they make the big game. They are actively lobbying for the "lesser" accommodations in Santa Clara.

## The 101 Problem

Why turn down five-star luxury? Simple math.

The distance from Union Square to the practice facilities in Santa Clara is roughly 45 miles. On a good day, that's an hour. On a bad day? Don't ask.

Even with a CHP (California Highway Patrol) escort, you can't teleport. We're talking about **two hours of daily bus time** just to get to practice and back. That's two hours of treatment time lost. Two hours of film study lost.

One AFC GM reportedly told the league office: *"Put us in a Motel 6 if it's within walking distance of the stadium. I don't care about the view."*

## The League's Dilemma

The NFL loves the visuals. They want the B-roll of players walking out of a luxury high-rise with the San Francisco skyline in the back. It sells the "destination" aspect of Super Bowl 60.

A business park in Santa Clara doesn't look as sexy on the 6 o'clock news.

But coaches are creatures of habit, and they are terrified of the Bay Area traffic. I'm told the league is scrambling to sweeten the deal for the SF hotel slot—possibly offering expanded meeting space or exclusive access to closer practice fields (Stanford?) to mitigate the travel time.

Watch this space. If the league forces the "glamour" hotel on a team, expect the first excuse for a loss to be "bus lag."
