I’ve seen it a dozen times. A crew flies in from Philly or Kansas City, rents a Tahoe, buys a cooler full of steaks, and rolls into the Blue Lot structure only to be told by security to put the grill back in the truck.

Levi’s Stadium is not a tailgating free-for-all. It is a zoned operation, and for Super Bowl 60, the restrictions are tighter than ever.

## The Surface Lot Rule

If your parking pass doesn't explicitly say **Green Lot 1** or **Green Lot 2**, you are likely in a parking structure or a remote dirt lot.

*   **Structures (Blue/Red):** No open flames allowed. No wood, no charcoal. Propane is sometimes tolerated if small, but for the Super Bowl, security sweeps are aggressive. The ceiling height kills the vibe anyway, and the acoustics are terrible.
*   **The Green Lots:** This is the "Gold Rush" zone. It is the only place with the classic tailgate atmosphere—grass, sun, and smoke. Passes here are currently trading on the secondary market for north of $650. If you see a "General Parking" pass for $100, it is not here.

## The "Directed Parking" Trap

Unlike regular season games where you might sneak into a spot next to your buddies, SB60 is operating on strict "Directed Parking." You pull in, and the wand-waver points you to the next available slot.

If you are trying to convoy with three cars, you must arrive **bumper-to-bumper**. If one car gets caught at a light on Tasman Drive, you will be parking four rows apart. The attendants will not hold a spot for your friend "just a minute behind you."

## The Walk-In Alternative

If you don't have a Green Lot pass, don't bother driving. The traffic on Great America Parkway is a gridlock nightmare.

The "Tailgate Membership" areas near the stadium entrance (like the Michael Mina Tailgate) are selling entry for $900+. My advice? Hit the **Hilton Santa Clara** parking lot parties. They often sell wristbands for all-you-can-eat/drink setups that are cheaper than a Green Lot pass and don't require you to be the designated driver.
