At approximately 1:45 PM on Super Bowl Sunday, the 49ers and their AFC opponents will depart their respective hotels. To the casual observer, it looks like a standard police escort.

It is actually a military-grade logistics operation known internally as **"Operation Red Route."**

## The Decoy Game

I spoke with a source within the CHP's Dignitary Protection Section who confirmed that for SB60, the security package has been upgraded to "Presidential-Lite."

This means **decoy motorcades**.

For each team, three identical convoys will leave the hotel property through different exits within a 5-minute window.
1.  **The Rabbit:** An empty convoy designed to draw early attention and clear traffic patterns.
2.  **The Package:** The actual team buses, flanked by counter-assault teams and jammer vehicles (look for the black SUVs with the dome antennas).
3.  **The Sweeper:** A backup convoy carrying support staff and equipment, ready to become the primary transport if "The Package" is compromised or stalled.

## The "Red Route" Lockdown

The route from the team hotel to Levi's Stadium is designated as a "Red Route."

Unlike a standard rolling roadblock, a Red Route involves the complete closure of on-ramps and overpasses 15 minutes prior to the convoy's arrival. The CHP has stationed officers on every single overpass along Highway 101 and Route 237 to prevent "drops" (objects thrown from bridges).

If you are planning to drive on the 101 between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM: **Don't.**

## The Tunnel Squeeze

The most anxious moment for security is the arrival at Levi's Stadium. The buses must navigate the **South Service Tunnel**, which has a clearance of 14 feet, 6 inches.

In previous years, drivers have practiced this turn dozens of times. The margin for error is slim. A stalled bus in the tunnel creates a security nightmare, trapping the players in a confined space.

My source tells me the drivers for Sunday are not the usual charter company employees. They are vetted law enforcement contractors with defensive driving certifications.

When you see the players walking off the bus with their headphones on, looking calm, remember: they are the cargo in a high-stakes tactical operation.
