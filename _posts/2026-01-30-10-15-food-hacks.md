I walked past the concession staging area this morning and saw the new digital menu boards being tested. You might want to sit down for this.

**Projected SB60 Prices:**
*   **Domestic Draft:** $19.00
*   **Craft Can (16oz):** $24.00
*   **Slice of Pizza:** $16.50
*   **Nachos:** $18.00

If you are sitting in the Club sections (United, Yahoo, Foxconn), you get the "Member Inclusive Menu" (free food). For the other 60,000 of us in the stands? We are on our own.

## The "Mercado" Strategy

Do not come to the stadium hungry. The lines will be long, and the prices are criminal.

Your best friend is the **Mercado Shopping Center**, located just south of the stadium on Mission College Blvd. It is about a 15-minute walk to the security gates.

*   **In-N-Out Burger:** There is one right there. The line will be out the door, but a Double-Double is still under $6.
*   **SmokeEaters:** Great wings, plenty of TVs. Good spot to kill time if you get dropped off early.
*   **World Wrapps:** Quick, heavy carbs. Good base for a long day of drinking.

## The Tailgate Reality

"Can't I just grill in the parking lot?"

Maybe. The NFL has locked down the tailgating rules for SB60.
*   **Green Lot 1:** Tailgating allowed (open flame permitted).
*   **Red Lots:** NO tailgating.
*   **Blue Lots:** NO tailgating.

If you don't have a specific "Tailgate Parking Pass" (which are reselling for $500+), do not bring the grill. You will be told to put it back in your car.

## The Water Loophole

Security is tight, but here is one thing they usually let slide: **One factory-sealed water bottle (up to 20 oz).**

Bring one. A bottle of Dasani inside is going to cost you $9. Hydrate in the lot, bring a bottle for the first quarter, and save your wallet for the inevitable $24 IPA in the second half.
