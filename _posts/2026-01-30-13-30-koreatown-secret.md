If you try to walk into a restaurant on Tasman Drive or Great America Parkway tonight, you are going to hit a wall. It is called the "Event Menu."

I just did a lap around the stadium perimeter. The standard $18 burger is gone. In its place are $150 prix-fixe "Game Day Experiences" and mandatory reservation deposits. The national chains and hotel bars within the one-mile "Security Ring" have essentially turned into private clubs for the corporate expense account crowd.

But if you are a local—or just smart—you know the real food scene in Santa Clara isn't by the stadium. It is on El Camino Real.

## The Lawrence Expressway Line

There is an invisible line at Lawrence Expressway. East of it (closer to the stadium), you pay the "Super Bowl Tax." West of it, you are in the heart of Santa Clara's Koreatown, and business is proceeding as usual.

This is the specific play for Friday and Saturday night:

1.  **Escape the Zone:** Do not try to eat at Santana Row or the Levi's perimeter. The wait times are currently hitting 3 hours.
2.  **Go to K-Town:** The stretch of El Camino Real between Lawrence Expressway and San Tomas Expressway is dense with Korean BBQ, Tofu Houses (Soondubu), and late-night fried chicken spots.
3.  **The Hours:** This is crucial. Most of the South Bay shuts down at 10:00 PM. The Korean spots on this strip often run until 2:00 AM. If you are coming out of a party or the stadium late, this is your only non-fast-food option.

## The Logistics Hack

Getting there is the trick. Rideshare surge pricing from the stadium is currently 4x normal rates.

Don't call the Uber from the Red Lot. Walk west on Tasman Drive, past the Convention Center, until you hit the Lick Mill light rail station area. It pushes you just outside the primary geofence. A ride from there to El Camino is $12 instead of $65.

You get better food, you pay normal prices, and you don't have to scream over a DJ playing "Sweet Caroline" for the 50th time.
