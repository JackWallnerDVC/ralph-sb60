Every year, the biggest stress for players isn't the game plan. It's the tickets.

For Super Bowl 60, the headache just turned into a migraine.

## The New Math

Historically, active roster players receive a standard allotment: **2 complimentary tickets** and the right to purchase **13 additional tickets** at face value (approx. $1,800 - $2,500 depending on location).

Multiple sources confirm that the NFL sent a memo to team logistics directors yesterday altering the deal for SB60.
*   **Complimentary:** 2
*   **Buy Option:** 11

Two tickets doesn't sound like a lot. But across two 53-man rosters, that’s 212 seats pulled from the "Family" pool.

## Where Did They Go?

I'm hearing the missing inventory has been reallocated to the **"Global Markets Program"**.

With the NFL pushing hard into Brazil, Germany, and Spain, a significant block of lower-level seats (approx. 1,500 total) has been reserved for international partners and contest winners. These aren't nosebleeds; these are the prime sections usually reserved for player families.

## The Locker Room Black Market

This reduction has triggered an immediate internal economy.

Veterans with large families are already approaching rookies and practice squad players (who get a smaller allotment of 2 comp / 4 buy) to purchase their rights.

The going rate inside the locker room right now? **$3,000 over face value** per ticket.

One agent told me this morning: "I have a client who needs 20 seats. He's going to spend his entire game check just getting his cousins into the building."
