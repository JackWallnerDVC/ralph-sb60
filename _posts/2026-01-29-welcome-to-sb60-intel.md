Welcome to **SB60 Intel**.

We are launching this platform with a single mission: to provide the most legitimate, in-depth coverage of Super Bowl 60. While others focus on the surface-level hype, we’re digging into the logistics, the analytics, and the local impact of the game coming to Levi’s Stadium on February 8, 2026.

## Beyond the Hype

Super Bowl 60 represents a massive logistical undertaking for Santa Clara and the broader Bay Area. Our coverage focuses on:

*   **Operations & Infrastructure:** Inside the multi-month transformation of Levi’s Stadium and the surrounding transit hubs.
*   **Data-Driven Analysis:** Moving beyond the betting lines to look at the historical trends and performance metrics that will define the matchup.
*   **The Local Fan Experience:** Navigating the Bay Area during one of the most crowded weeks in its history.

## Why SB60 Intel?

This is the first time Levi's Stadium has hosted the Super Bowl, and the requirements have evolved significantly since the NFL last visited the Bay Area for SB50. We are here to document that transition with reporting rooted in fact and specific detail.

The road to Santa Clara starts now. Stay tuned for updates as the field conversion and team preparations begin in earnest.
