Yo! Welcome to **SB60 Intel**.

We're live and ready to bring you comprehensive coverage of Super Bowl 60, coming February 8, 2026, to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.

## What to Expect

Starting today, we're publishing **4 times daily**:

- **6 AM UTC** — The Analyst breaking down the numbers  
- **12 PM UTC** — The Local guiding you through the Bay Area
- **6 PM UTC** — Rotating coverage with bonus insights

## Why SB60 Matters

This isn't just another Super Bowl. Levi's Stadium hasn't hosted before, and the Bay Area hasn't seen one since Super Bowl 50. The stadium crew is already in prep mode—I've been hearing about field preparations starting earlier than usual.
