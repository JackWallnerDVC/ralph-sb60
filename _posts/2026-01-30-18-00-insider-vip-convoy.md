If you are stuck in traffic on Great America Parkway and a police motorcycle forces you onto the shoulder to let a line of black Mercedes Sprinters pass, do not expect a wave. You just met a V-VIP convoy.

## The "Hardened" Lanes
While fans are funneled into the VTA checkpoints and pedestrian bridges, the NFL security team has designated specific "hardened lanes" for team owners, league executives, and high-tier dignitaries.

These routes are swept by K-9 units two hours before the convoy moves. They are monitored by the "Eye in the Sky" (the command center helicopter). They do not stop for red lights.

## The Price of an Escort
I spoke with a logistics coordinator who confirmed that these escorts are not a public service; they are a purchased commodity.
*   **The Cost:** Private security escorts utilizing off-duty officers (in uniform) run approximately $150-$200 per officer, per hour.
*   **The Package:** A standard owner's arrival package includes two lead motorcycles, one trail car, and the primary transport vehicle.
*   **The Bill:** The teams pay this tab, not the city.

## The Marshaling Yard Entry
These convoys do not use Gate A or C. They enter through the "Marshaling Yard" on the southeast side of the stadium, a heavily fortified loading dock area that is usually reserved for broadcast trucks.

Once inside, the V-VIPs are offloaded into a "sterile zone"—a corridor that has been cleared of all stadium staff except for those with a specific "Zone 1" credential. They take a dedicated freight elevator directly to the owner's suite level, bypassing the concourses entirely.

## The Decoy Strategy
Here is the wildest part: For the highest-profile targets (like the Commissioner or visiting Heads of State), the security team runs "ghost convoys." They will send a three-car motorcade down Tasman Drive to draw attention, while the actual VIP arrives in an unmarked SUV via the employee entrance on the other side of the complex.
