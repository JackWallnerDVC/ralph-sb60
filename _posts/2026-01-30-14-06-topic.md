If you think you’re ordering a pizza to your hotel on Tasman Drive this week, you’re about to learn a hard lesson in perimeter security.

I watched a DoorDash driver try to argue with a private security contractor at the checkpoint on Tasman and Great America Parkway yesterday. It didn't end well. The driver had a bag full of burritos, the customer was a mile away at the Hyatt, and the guard wasn't budging. That driver ended up leaving the food on the sidewalk because he couldn't get through and couldn't wait.

## The Delivery Dead Zone

Here is the reality of the "Soft Perimeter" that just went up. Delivery drivers do not have the Vehicle Access Pass (VAP) required to breach the zone. If you are staying at the Hyatt, the Hilton, or any of the hotels inside the cordon, your delivery app will still let you place the order. But the driver will hit a concrete wall at the checkpoint.

Your option? Walk 1.5 miles round-trip to the checkpoint to pick up your cold food.

Since delivery is dead, you have to go to the food. But you need to know which direction to walk, because half the roads are closed.

## Santa Clara Square: The Walkable Feast

This is your lifeline. Santa Clara Square, right off Bowers Avenue, is the closest dining hub that sits completely *outside* the security cordon.

It is exactly a 20-minute walk from the stadium gates. You don't need a pass to get there. You don't need to fight a checkpoint.

*   **Il Fornaio:** If you need a serious meal before the chaos, this is the spot. It’s carb-loading central.
*   **Puesto:** Good tacos, strong margaritas. It gets packed, but the line moves.

The strategy is simple: Park here early (or get dropped off here), eat a real meal at normal prices, and then walk the 20 minutes to the gate. You skip the traffic gridlock and you enter the stadium with a full stomach.

## The Mercado Warning

A lot of out-of-towners look at the map, see the In-N-Out at the Mercado Shopping Center, and think, "Perfect."

Don't do it.

Because of the road closures on Tasman, all the displaced traffic is funneling onto Mission College Blvd. The drive-thru line at that In-N-Out is currently bleeding out into the main road. I clocked it at 45 minutes yesterday at 2:00 PM.

If you are at the Mercado, hit the **Whole Foods**. It is the only place you can grab tailgate supplies—water, chips, fruit—without paying stadium markup. Just remember, you can't bring that food inside the stadium, so eat it in the parking lot.

## Rivermark: The Local's Labyrinth

Rivermark Plaza is the other big dining spot, but it’s tricky this year. The intersection of Agnew and Lafayette is closed to non-residents. If you are trying to drive there from the stadium side, you will get turned around.

You have to approach from the south. **Fleming's Steakhouse** is over there. If your team wins (whoever that ends up being), that’s the spot for the celebration dinner. If they lose, well, they have a good wine list.

## The Concession Math

Why go through all this trouble? Have you seen the concession prices for SB60?

I got a look at the price sheet. A basic hot dog is $18. A domestic beer is $22. If you want to feed a family of four inside Levi's, you are dropping $200 before you even get to souvenirs.

Plus, the NFL "Clear Bag" policy is in full effect. You cannot bring in outside food unless it's medically necessary. Security is checking bags with a level of scrutiny I haven't seen since the last time we hosted.

Save your money. Eat at the Square. Walk it off. Buy the beer inside if you must, but don't let the perimeter starve you out.
