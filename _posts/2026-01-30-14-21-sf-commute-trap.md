Yo,

I had a buddy from Chicago book the Westin St. Francis for SB60. "It's the San Francisco 49ers," he argued. "How far can the stadium be?"

Forty-five miles. That is the answer.

Levi's Stadium is not in San Francisco. It is in Santa Clara, a land of office parks and wide boulevards that is closer to San Jose than the Golden Gate Bridge. If you look at a map, the stadium is at the bottom of the Bay, while the city is at the tip of the peninsula.

If you stay in the city on game day, here is your Sunday reality:

## The Uber Gamble
Rideshare apps are predicting "Black Event" surge pricing. A standard UberX from Union Square to Great America Parkway is projected to hit **$220-$280 one way** on Sunday morning. The drive, normally 50 minutes without traffic, will likely push 90 minutes to two hours as the 101 South turns into a parking lot near the Moffett Field exit.

## The Caltrain Haul
The "smart" move is the train, but it is not a subway ride. You catch Caltrain at 4th & King in SF. You ride it for about an hour to the Mountain View station. Then—and this is the bottleneck—you must transfer to the VTA Light Rail (Orange Line) or a shuttle bus to get to the stadium. It is reliable, but it is a solid two-hour commit from door to seat.

## The Split Strategy
If you want the "Super Bowl City" vibe with the concerts, the media center at Moscone, and the fan experience at the Embarcadero, that is all in San Francisco. Stay there Thursday through Saturday.

But for the game? Move south. Book Saturday night in **Milpitas, Sunnyvale, or North San Jose**. You want to wake up within 5 miles of the stadium. The difference between a 15-minute surface street drive and a 2-hour highway crawl is the difference between enjoying your $15 beer and chugging it in panic.
