It is the most ridiculous and lucrative prop bet on the board: What color will the Gatorade be?

Vegas books currently have Orange at +300 and Lime/Yellow at +350. But the days of a loose-lipped equipment manager leaking the flavor are over. I spoke with a league official who detailed the "Gatorade Protocol" for Super Bowl 60, and it is bordering on paranoia.

## The Sterile Room

The Gatorade is not mixed on the sideline. It is prepared in a "Hydration Prep Area" located in the tunnel near the X-Ray room, a zone that is strictly off-limits to media.

For Sunday, three 10-gallon coolers will be prepared for each team.
1.  **The Decoys:** Two coolers are mixed with standard water or electrolyte powder that matches the team's secondary colors.
2.  **The Hero:** One cooler contains the actual "dunk" liquid.

Only two athletic trainers per team are authorized to be in the room during the mix. Once the lids are secured, they are sealed with numbered, tamper-evident security tape—the same kind used for urine samples in drug testing.

## The Opaque Cup Rule

You might think you can spot the color when players are drinking during the game. Wrong.

The NFL has mandated the use of opaque, green squeeze bottles and solid paper cups on the bench. Clear plastic cups have been banned from the sideline to prevent high-resolution cameras from picking up the liquid's hue.

## The Spotter War

Why the secrecy? Because six-figure bets land on this prop in the final hour. I'm told that major sportsbooks have "spotters" in the lower bowl with high-powered binoculars trained exclusively on the hydration stations, looking for a spill or a translucent spout.

If you see a trainer aggressively guarding a cooler that nobody is drinking from in the 4th quarter, you've found the target. Just don't expect to see what's inside until it's airborne.
