The concrete barriers dropped onto Tasman Drive this morning weren't just for traffic control. As of 14:00 hours today, Levi's Stadium has officially entered **Phase III Lockdown**.

I spoke with a league operations director this morning who described the transition: "The venue is no longer a stadium. It is a federal fortress."

## The SEAR 1 Reality
Super Bowl 60 is a SEAR 1 (Special Event Assessment Rating) event—the highest security designation the Department of Homeland Security gives. It puts the Secret Service in charge of the perimeter.

Here is what that means right now inside the wire:

1.  **The Credential Freeze:** As of noon, "all-access" team credentials stopped working. Even front office executives for the 49ers and the AFC champion are now restricted to specific zones. If your badge doesn't have the holographic "Zone 1" laminate, you aren't getting near the locker rooms.
2.  **The Mag and Bag:** During the regular season, stadium staff breeze through a side door. Starting today, every employee—from the concession workers to the broadcast technicians—goes through airport-style screening. I'm hearing wait times at the staff entry gate are already pushing 45 minutes.
3.  **The K-9 Sweeps:** The "bomb dogs" are currently sweeping the delivery docks. Every single pallet of hot dog buns or merchandise entering the perimeter is being hand-inspected.

## The "Clean Zone" Enforcement
The most visible change inside the perimeter is the "Clean Zone" enforcement.

I watched a crew of six workers spending three hours this morning taping over the logos on a soda vending machine in the lower concourse because it wasn't a league sponsor. The NFL's brand protection team is ruthless. If it's not an official partner, it gets covered in black gaffer tape or removed.

## The Shadow Roster
One interesting note: I'm told the teams have submitted their "Shadow Roster" lists to security. these are the non-player personnel (IT staff, equipment managers, medical consultants) who are approved for field access. The list was locked at 10:00 AM. If a coach wants to bring in a specialist consultant on Sunday who isn't on that list, they are out of luck. The Secret Service doesn't do last-minute additions.
