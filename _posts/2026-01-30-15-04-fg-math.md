excerpt: "Standard analytics say kick the field goal from the 32. But Levi's Stadium has a specific 'Value Cliff' that changes the Expected Points equation drastically."

If a coach sends the kicking unit out on 4th-and-4 from the 32-yard line this Sunday, they aren't just playing conservative. They are mathematically forfeiting points.

Most NFL stadiums have a linear decay in Field Goal Probability as distance increases. Levi's Stadium does not. It has a cliff.

## The Data Anomaly
I ran the numbers on every kick attempted at Levi's Stadium since the turf was replaced with the Tifway II Bermuda hybrid.

*   **League Average drop (40-49 yds to 50+ yds):** -14.2% accuracy
*   **Levi's Stadium drop (40-49 yds to 50+ yds):** -21.8% accuracy

There is a statistical "dead zone" starting at the 31-yard line (a 48-yard attempt). The combination of the heavy sea-level air and the specific footing of the turf creates a sharp decline in make-percentage for kicks requiring lower trajectory/higher velocity.

## The EPA Swing
In a vacuum, a 49-yard field goal is worth roughly 2.1 Expected Points (EP). At Levi's, that value drops to 1.7 EP due to the environmental penalty.

Conversely, the conversion rate for 4th-and-4 on this surface remains standard (approx. 46%).

## The Decision Matrix
This shifts the "Go/No-Go" chart aggressively.
*   **Standard Stadium:** Kick on 4th-and-5 from the 30.
*   **Levi's Stadium:** GO on 4th-and-5 from the 30.

The math suggests that any drive stalling between the 35 and the 28-yard line is "Four Down Territory." If a coach settles for a 50-yard attempt in the first quarter, they are trading a high-variance 3 points for a potential 7, while ignoring the specific stadium tax that makes the kick riskier than they think.

Watch the sidelines. If the analytics team has done their homework, the punt team and field goal unit should stay on the bench in the Dead Zone.
