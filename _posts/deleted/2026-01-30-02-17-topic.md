I'm hearing the security playbook for Super Bowl LX is getting a high-tech boost.

## Understanding the Expanded Security Perimeter

The security perimeter around Levi's Stadium is getting bigger. I'm told it's expanding to a three-block radius. This isn't just window dressing; it's about creating a layered defense. The goal is simple: a secure zone for everyone involved. Expect more checkpoints and a visible security presence.

The expansion means the security footprint jumps from roughly 1.2 square miles to nearly 2.5. That's a significant increase. I'm also told there will be at least 20 access points, each manned by a combination of local PD, private security, and even some National Guard personnel.

With the scope of the expanded perimeter established, let's examine the real-time drone monitoring system that will be a key component of its security.

## Real-Time Drone Monitoring System

Forget static cameras; the future is in the air. Real-time drone monitoring will give a bird's-eye view of the stadium and surrounding areas. These aren't your hobbyist drones; they're equipped with advanced cameras feeding live footage to a unified command center. The idea? Spot trouble before it happens and react faster.

I'm hearing we're talking about a fleet of at least ten drones, operational 24/7 during the week leading up to the game. These drones are the DJI Matrice 300 RTK model, boasting 4K resolution, thermal imaging, and a 55x hybrid zoom. The unified command center is located inside the stadium's operations hub, bringing together Santa Clara PD, the FBI, and DHS.

Now that we've explored the capabilities of the drone monitoring system, let's consider the data storage and security protocols in place to protect sensitive information.

## Data Storage and Security Protocols

No one wants Big Brother watching. That's why I'm assured stringent data protocols are in place. Encryption, access controls, and strict retention policies are the name of the game. The aim is to balance security with privacy.

The drone footage is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Access is limited to authorized personnel with security clearances. The retention policy dictates footage is deleted after 72 hours unless flagged for investigation. All of this is in line with California's drone laws and Fourth Amendment protections.

With data security addressed, let's examine the financial aspects of implementing and operating the drone monitoring system.

## Costs and Funding of Drone Monitoring

This kind of tech doesn't come cheap. Implementing the drone system involves a hefty investment. Equipment, personnel, software, it all adds up. But the NFL and the city are betting it's worth it.

The estimated total cost is $1.8 million. That breaks down to $500,000 for the drones themselves, $700,000 for personnel (pilots, analysts, security), and $600,000 for the software and command center upgrades. Funding comes from a mix of NFL security funds, city coffers, and a DHS grant.

Having considered the financial investment, let's compare this drone monitoring system to those used at previous Super Bowls and other major events.

## Comparison with Previous Security Measures

This isn't the first time drones have been used for security, but the scale is new. Compared to previous Super Bowls, the coverage area is significantly larger, and the tech is more advanced. Lessons from past events have shaped this system.

The drone coverage area is 40% larger than the perimeter used at Super Bowl 50. Response times are projected to decrease by 15% thanks to the real-time aerial view. At a recent music festival, a similar drone system helped identify and mitigate three potential security threats before they escalated.
