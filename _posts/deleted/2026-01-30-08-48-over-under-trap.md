If you look at the ticket count at major sportsbooks this morning, the public is convinced SB60 is going to be a shootout. 72% of bets are on the Over (47.5).

But if you follow the money—specifically the large wagers coming from professional syndicates—the story flips. 65% of the handle is on the Under. Whenever you see a ticket/money split this drastic, you need to pay attention to the math that the pros are seeing.

## The Pace of Play Illusion

Both offenses are explosive, which drives the public perception. However, "explosive" does not mean "fast."

When we look at **Neutral Situation Pace** (seconds per play when the score is within 7 points), both San Francisco and their opponent rank in the bottom quartile of the league (28th and 24th, respectively). These teams huddle. They bleed the play clock. They shorten the game.

Fewer snaps equal fewer opportunities to score. The models project roughly 122 combined plays for this game. The league average is 128. That missing six-play variance is often the difference between hitting 48 points and staying at 44.

## The Cheffers Effect

The officiating crew assignment is the hidden variable here. Carl Cheffers is the head referee. In games officiated by his crew this season, offensive holding calls are 18% above the league average.

Holding penalties are drive-killers. A 1st-and-20 conversion rate is less than 14% for these specific offenses. If Cheffers calls the game tight on the offensive line—which he historically does in primetime spots—we are going to see stalled drives and field goals instead of touchdowns.

## The Red Zone Regression

As noted in earlier reports, San Francisco has overperformed in the red zone (68% TD rate). Regression to the mean suggests that number is unsustainable against a top-5 DVOA defense. If just two of those red zone trips turn into field goals, the Over is dead.

The math points to a 24-20 style grind, not the 35-31 fireworks show the public is buying.
