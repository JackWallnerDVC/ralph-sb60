Red zone efficiency isn't sexy. It doesn't make highlight reels. But it wins championships.

## The Numbers

San Francisco's offense converts 68% of red zone appearances into touchdowns. League average hovers around 59%. Their Super Bowl opponent sits at 62%.

That 6-10 percentage point advantage doesn't sound dramatic until you realize the average team visits the red zone 3.2 times per game. Over a full game, that's a full possession worth of points.

## Why It Matters for SB60

Levi's Stadium has a shallow end zone. The north end zone measures just 8 yards deep (standard is 10). Kickers hate it. Offensive coordinators love it.

Shorter fields compress the playbook. Vertical routes get squeezed. Play-action becomes harder to sell because safeties creep closer. The team that can run power formations effectively gains an edge.

## The Prop Bet Angle

Look at "team to score first" markets. Teams with superior red zone efficiency tend to score early more often—they capitalize on opening drives when scripts are tightest.

Also watch "total field goals under." Compressed end zones mean more goal-to-go situations and fewer long attempts.

The red zone doesn't get the glory. It gets the wins.
