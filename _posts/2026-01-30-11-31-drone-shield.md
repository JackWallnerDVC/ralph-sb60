excerpt: "The FAA has established a 30-mile 'No Drone Zone' around Levi's Stadium. But the enforcement isn't just legal—it's kinetic. Inside the RF jamming tech that will keep the sky clear."

You will see the Black Hawks circling. You will see the snipers on the catwalks. But the most sophisticated security measure at Super Bowl 60 is invisible.

It’s the **Drone Shield**.

## The 30-Mile Bubble

The FAA has officially issued the Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) for Sunday. It is a massive cylinder of airspace: a 30-nautical-mile radius centered on Santa Clara, extending up to 18,000 feet.

Commercial flights into SFO and San Jose are routed around it. But the real target isn't a Boeing 747; it's the DJI Mavic Pro you got for Christmas.

## Protocol 4: Severing the Link

I spoke with a security consultant coordinating with federal agencies on-site. He confirmed that Levi's Stadium is equipped with "passive and active counter-UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) technology."

In plain English: They aren't just watching. They are jamming.

While local law enforcement is generally prohibited from jamming radio signals, the FBI and DHS (who are running point on SB60 security) have specific statutory authority to deploy "non-kinetic mitigation."

If a drone crosses the perimeter fence, the system doesn't shoot it down (falling debris is a liability). Instead, it blasts a targeted RF signal that severs the connection between the pilot's controller and the drone.

"The drone thinks it lost signal," the source told me. "Depending on the model, it either hovers in place until the battery dies, or it attempts to 'Return to Home'—which usually leads the police right to the pilot."

## The "Aeroscope" Dragnet

The system also identifies the pilot's location instantly. The moment a drone powers on within the TFR, sensors mounted on the stadium lights (likely DJI Aeroscope or similar tech) triangulate the signal.

"We know where the pilot is standing before the drone leaves the ground," the consultant said.

## The Cost of a View

The fines for violating the SB60 TFR are aggressive: **$30,000** in civil penalties and potential federal criminal charges.

If you're thinking about getting a cool aerial shot of the halftime show: Don't. Your screen will go black, your drone will vanish, and agents will be tapping on your shoulder within three minutes.
