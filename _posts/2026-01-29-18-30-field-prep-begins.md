I'm hearing the Levi's Stadium grounds crew kicked into high gear this week.

**Sources say** the NFL operations team arrived earlier than expected—three weeks ahead of the typical Super Bowl timeline. Usually, stadium crews get two weeks for full conversion. This year? They're getting nearly a month.

## What's Different

The field transformation at Levi's isn't just cosmetic. For SB60, they're:

- Installing a hybrid grass surface (new for this venue)
- Reconfiguring tunnel access for broadcast camera mobility  
- Expanding sideline real estate by 8 feet on each side

**Why the rush?** One source told me the league wants "zero surprises" after the rainy conditions that complicated Super Bowl 50's field prep at the same venue a decade ago.

## The Broadcast Angle

CBS Sports has already locked down their compound locations. I'm hearing:

- 32 cameras (up from 28 last year)
- Two new "super slow-mo" positions in the end zones
- A drone program that required special FAA clearance for the stadium airspace

The league isn't taking chances. Not with this game.
