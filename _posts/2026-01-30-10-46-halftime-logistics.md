I just got off the phone with a production source who sounded breathless. The final dress rehearsal for the halftime show ran 45 seconds long last night. In the world of live Super Bowl broadcasting, 45 seconds is an eternity. It costs millions.

The problem isn't the setlist. It’s the **Southwest Tunnel**.

## The Pinch Point

Levi's Stadium has wide access points, but the halftime show stage—which is broken down into 18 modular carts—is being staged in the loading dock behind the Southwest corner.

My source tells me that Cart #4 (which carries the main riser) has a clearance of just three inches on either side when navigating the turn onto the field. During the rehearsal, a safety sensor tripped on the cart's motorized wheel, freezing the unit for 30 seconds.

"It was a parking lot," the source said. "We had 200 field cast members stuck behind a frozen cart while the clock was ticking."

## The Turf War

There is also significant friction between the halftime production team and the NFL's turf management crew.

The stage this year is heavy. I'm hearing it weighs 12 tons fully assembled. The turf crew is demanding that the "tire pressure" on the transport carts be lowered to prevent rutting on the natural grass surface.

The production team is pushing back, arguing that softer tires make the carts harder to push manually if the motors fail (like they did last night).

## The "Dark Ops" Solution

To fix the timing, the league has authorized a "Dark Ops" contingency.

Usually, the field cast (the volunteers who run onto the field) help assemble the stage. For Sunday, I'm told the league is bringing in 50 additional union stagehands dressed in all-black "ninja" gear to handle the heavy lifting of Cart #4 and Cart #5.

If you see a group of people sprinting onto the field who don't look like they are part of the choreography, that's the fix. They have exactly 360 seconds to get that stage built and locked, or the show starts without a center platform.
