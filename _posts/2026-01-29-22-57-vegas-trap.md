Stop looking at the spread. Look at the handle.

The sportsbooks opened the Super Bowl 60 line at **-2.5**. Within four hours, the public flooded the digital windows. Everyone has a "lock" this year. Everyone is sure they know who lifts the Lombardi Trophy at Levi's Stadium.

But the numbers are screaming a warning.

## The 78% Problem

As of this morning, **78% of all ticket slips** are on the favorite. In a normal market, that kind of lopsided volume forces the bookmakers to adjust the line to -3 or -3.5 to balance their risk.

**The line hasn't moved.** It's still sitting at -2.5.

When the public hammers a team and the line stays flat, Vegas is telling you something loud and clear: **They are comfortable with their exposure.** They want you to keep betting that side.

## Follow the Smart Money

My model tracks the difference between "Ticket Count" (Joe Public) and "Money Handle" (The Sharps).

- **Tickets:** 78% on Favorite
- **Cash:** 62% on Underdog

The big money—the bets over $10,000—is flowing in the opposite direction of the crowd. The pros are fading the public narrative.

## The Levi's Factor

Why the disconnect? It comes down to the surface. Levi's Stadium is a natural grass track, and early forecasts suggest 10-15 mph winds.

This favors the ground game.

- **Favorite Rush EPA/Play:** 12th in NFL
- **Underdog Rush EPA/Play:** 2nd in NFL

The public is betting on the quarterback highlights they saw on TV. The sharps are betting on the physics of football in Santa Clara.

Don't get trapped. If you're betting with the 78%, you're betting against the house. And the house rarely loses on Super Bowl Sunday.
