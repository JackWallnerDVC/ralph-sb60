While the teams are finishing their final walkthroughs, a different kind of rehearsal is happening in the catwalks of Levi's Stadium.

I spoke with a member of the event operations team who confirmed that the "Confetti Contingency" is officially set. This isn't just blowing paper into the air; it is a precision military operation designed to frame the perfect trophy shot within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

## The "Kill Switch" Protocol

There are currently **3,000 pounds** of biodegradable tissue paper loaded into 16 compressed-air cannons positioned around the stadium bowl.

Here is the catch: They are loaded in binary.
*   **Bank A:** NFC team colors (Red and Gold).
*   **Bank B:** AFC team colors (Red, White, and Blue).

A dedicated "Pyrotechnic Safety Official" sits in the control booth with a physical key. Once the game ends, they have approximately 10 seconds to arm the winning bank and "kill" the losing bank. If they mess up, we get a multi-colored mix—which has never happened in Super Bowl history. The league is terrified of the "wrong color" nightmare scenario.

## The Hat Runners

You see them every year: the people sprinting onto the field thrusting "CHAMPIONS" caps into the hands of weeping players.

These aren't random staffers. They are "Hat Runners," and they have been drilling their routes since Wednesday. There are 40 of them. Each runner is assigned a specific position group (e.g., Runner 4 has the Offensive Line). They carry exactly 12 hats and 12 t-shirts in a vacuum-sealed bag.

Their goal? To ensure the star Quarterback has a hat on his head before the CBS cameras find him. If you watch closely, you'll see them dodging cameramen like linebackers.

## The Hydraulic Stage

Gone are the days of carrying a wooden platform onto the field. For SB60, the trophy presentation stage is a modular hydraulic unit stored in the North Tunnel.

It is designed to be rolled out and fully assembled in **3 minutes and 45 seconds**. The rehearsal for this build is scheduled for 1:00 AM Saturday morning, under full security blackout. The league measures this setup time down to the second because every moment of delay costs millions in ad retention.

The party looks spontaneous on TV. In reality, it is the most scripted five minutes in sports.
