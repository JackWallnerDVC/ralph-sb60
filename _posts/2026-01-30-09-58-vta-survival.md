I watched a guy from Chicago cry at the Red Lot 7 drop-off zone during the NFC Championship game. He had just paid $185 for a 12-minute Uber ride, and then realized he still had a 25-minute walk to the stadium entrance.

For Super Bowl 60, it’s going to be worse.

## The Rideshare Trap

The NFL and the City of Santa Clara have pushed the rideshare zone (Uber/Lyft) further out for security reasons. You are not getting dropped off at the front door. You are getting dropped off in a dusty lot near the golf course.

**The Math:**
*   **Base Fare:** $25
*   **SB60 Surge Multiplier:** Projected 6x - 10x
*   **Walking Distance:** 1.1 miles from drop-off to Gate A.

## The VTA Cheat Code

Locals know the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Light Rail is the only way to get close. The **Great America Station** is literally right in front of the stadium.

Here is the play:

1.  **Park Away:** Drive to the **Milpitas Transit Center** (if coming from East Bay) or **Mountain View Station** (if coming from the Peninsula). Parking is usually $5-$10.
2.  **The Orange/Green Line:** Hop on the Orange Line (Mountain View) or Green Line (Milpitas).
3.  **Cost:** $5 for a day pass. Not $200. Five dollars.
4.  **The Drop:** The train drops you off on Tasman Drive. You walk across the street, go through security, and you are in.

## The "Clipper" Tip

Do not wait in line at the ticket vending machines at the station. They are slow, and the touchscreens are terrible.

Download the **Clipper** app on your phone right now. Load $10 onto it. You can tap your phone at the card reader on the platform and walk right on.

Save that Uber money for the $18 beers inside.
