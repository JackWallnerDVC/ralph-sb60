The NFL’s protection of its intellectual property is legendary, but the enforcement around Super Bowl LX is reaching unprecedented levels.

## The "Clean Zone" Expansion

I have obtained a memo sent to Santa Clara city officials outlining the "Clean Zone" perimeter for Super Bowl week. Historically, this zone—where only official NFL sponsors are allowed to display branding—extends 300 feet from the stadium.

For SB60, that radius has been expanded to **one mile**.

This morning, a squad of what local merchants are calling the "Brand Police"—officially the **Ambush Marketing Response Team (AMRT)**—was spotted on Tasman Drive handing out warnings.

## The "Super Bowl" Ban

I spoke with the owner of a sandwich shop on Great America Parkway who received a cease-and-desist notice at 9:30 AM. His offense? A chalkboard sign on the sidewalk reading "Super Bowl Sub Special."

The NFL holds the trademark on the phrase "Super Bowl." They also police "Super Sunday," "The Big Game" (in certain contexts), and the team names.

The notice, which I have reviewed, threatens legal action and potential seizure of "infringing materials" if the sign is not removed within four hours. It cites the **Lanham Act** and specific clauses in the host city agreement signed by Santa Clara.

## The "Blackout" Tape

It is not just text. I’m hearing that a popular sports bar near the convention center was ordered to cover up a mural that featured a generic football player wearing red and gold. Even though no logos were visible, the AMRT argued that the "trade dress" implied an association with the San Francisco 49ers, who are an NFL franchise.

The bar owner was given two options: paint over it or cover it with opaque black vinyl. They chose the vinyl.

Expect to see a lot of black tape on Tasman Drive this week. The league is protecting a sponsorship ecosystem worth over $1.5 billion, and they are not making exceptions for mom-and-pop shops.
