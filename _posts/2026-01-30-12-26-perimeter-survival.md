The NFL doesn't just rent the stadium; they annex the neighborhood. If you live or work near Levi's Stadium, you have seen the fences going up since Tuesday. This isn't just traffic control; it is the enforcement of the "Clean Zone."

Here is the reality on the ground in Santa Clara right now for anyone trying to navigate the grid.

## The Hard Perimeter

As of 6:00 AM Friday, **Tasman Drive** is dead to civilian traffic between Calle Del Sol and the Convention Center. Do not try to "cut through" to get to the 101. I watched a delivery driver argue with a DHS agent this morning near the Great America station. The driver lost.

**Great America Parkway** is technically open, but it is effectively a parking lot for black SUVs and production trucks. If you are trying to get to the Mercado shopping center, go around via Mission College Blvd. The lights have been retimed for stadium flow, meaning cross-traffic waits 5-7 minutes for a green light.

## The "Clean Zone" Ordinance

You might notice your favorite deli or liquor store on Old Ironsides has taped over their neon signs. That is the Clean Zone ordinance in effect. Within a 1-mile radius of the stadium, only official NFL sponsors can display branding visible from the street.

This ordinance is strictly enforced. Local businesses are not trying to be rude; they are trying to avoid massive fines. Support these spots anyway—they are losing foot traffic because regular folks are scared to enter the zone.

## The Rideshare Trap

The app says it will drop you at the "Stadium Entrance." It is lying. The designated drop-off zone is at the **Santa Clara Convention Center**, specifically the lot off Bunker Hill.

That is a solid 20-minute walk to the actual gates once you factor in the security checkpoint queues. The "pedestrian bridge" over Tasman is a choke point. Wear comfortable shoes, and do not bring a bag if you can avoid it. The bag check lines at the perimeter are moving slower than the TSA at SFO.

## The Secret VTA Hack

If you are meeting people near the stadium but don't have a ticket, the VTA Light Rail is the only motorized vehicle allowed to penetrate the hard perimeter. However, they are doing ticket checks *before* you board at Mountain View or Milpitas.

If you don't have a valid VTA fare, they won't let you on the platform. Once you are on the train, you get dropped right at the stadium gates, bypassing the road closures. It is the only way to beat the blockade.

Don't let the fences scare you off, but respect the perimeter. The tow trucks are circling like sharks, and the impound fees are Super Bowl-sized.
