# Spec: Super Bowl 60 Blog Platform & Hosting

## Goal
Establish a free, published, and sustainable hosting platform for the SB60 blog.

## Requirements
- Use a free hosting tier (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify).
- Support a Static Site Generator (SSG) like Jekyll, Hugo, or Next.js for easy agent-driven updates.
- Domain: Use a free sub-domain initially (e.g., `sb60-intel.github.io`).
- Automation: Must be updatable via git commits from an agent.

## Definition of Done
- Site is live at a public URL.
- Hello World post is visible.
- Deployment pipeline is confirmed (commit -> live site).
