      "description": "The City of Santa Clara just confirmed the nightmare: Tasman Drive is officially closed from Jan 28 to Feb 13. This isn't just game day traffic; it's a two-week infrastructure lockdown. If you rely on the VTA drop-off or rideshare at the main gate, you are walking into a bottleneck.",

      "insider_tip": "Avoid the 'Vehicle Detour' signs like the plague. Instead, get dropped at the Mercado center on Mission College Blvd, grab a burger at In-N-Out, and walk the Creek Trail north. You skip the entire security checkpoint queue at Tasman.",

      "description": "With the 'Clean Zone' enforcement hardening the perimeter, delivery drivers are being turned away at the checkpoints. The stadium area is now a food desert unless you have a credential. We are mapping the 'Calories vs. Checkpoints' strategy for fans who want to eat real food before entering the bubble.",

      ],
      "insider_tip": "Santa Clara Square is the golden zone. It is technically outside the vehicle hard perimeter, so you can park or Uber there easily, but it's a short 15-minute walk to the stadium gates. It's the best pre-game meetup spot that doesn't require a ticket.",

      "description": "The 'Multi-Agency Security Unification' is in effect, meaning SFPD and San Mateo units are patrolling Santa Clara lots. The vibe is stricter, and the Media Compound has swallowed half of Blue Lot 1. The party has moved, and the rules have tightened.",
