      "description": "The 'Morning Report' flags Red Zone efficiency as a key narrative. The data confirms it: 49ers are converting 68% of RZ trips into TDs (League Rank: #1), creating a massive value gap against a defense allowing 55%. This isn't just 'good offense'—it's a mathematical probability tilt worth 4 points per game.",

      "betting_insights": "The market often prices RZ efficiency as a wash. It isn't. Look for '49ers Team Total Over' and 'Anytime TD' for the primary RZ back. If the spread is <3, this efficiency gap covers the spread alone."

      "description": "While the general narrative focuses on 'QB Performance', the granular data reveals a cliff. The 49ers QB's completion percentage drops from 72% (clean) to 44% (pressure). With the opponent's pass rush win rate at 28%, the 'Under' on passing yards is statistically protected.",
