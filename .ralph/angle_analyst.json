      "description": "The 49ers are converting 68% of red zone trips into touchdowns, compared to their opponent's 52%. This 16% delta is the most significant statistical mismatch of SB60. We analyze whether the market has adjusted for this 'four-point swing' potential per red zone visit.",

      "betting_insights": "If the spread is < 3, the Red Zone efficiency gap suggests value on the 49ers Moneyline. Also, look for 'Over 2.5 Field Goals' for the opponent if their RZ stall rate is high, and 'Anytime TD' for 49ers RBs who get the goal-line carries."
