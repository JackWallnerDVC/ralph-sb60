      "description": "Will the 49ers' red zone efficiency hold up in the Super Bowl? We'll quantify their playoff red zone performance against regular season numbers, identifying key statistical indicators and projecting the impact on SB60 scoring outcomes. Is their earlier success sustainable, or will regression to the mean create betting opportunities?",

      "betting_insights": "If the 49ers' red zone efficiency is projected to significantly regress (20%+ decrease), consider shorting their team total and targeting 'under' prop bets on key offensive players. Sustained dominance (less than 5% decrease) opens 'over' opportunities. Watch for line movement based on injury reports."

Exploit discrepancies between public perception and data-driven projections. Look for advantageous moneyline opportunities if the underdog's implied win probability exceeds their DVOA-based win probability by 10%."
