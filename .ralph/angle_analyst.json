      "description": "Will the 49ers' red zone efficiency (68% TD rate) hold up in SB60? We'll quantify their playoff red zone performance against regular season numbers, identifying key statistical indicators and projecting the impact on scoring outcomes. Is their earlier success sustainable, or will regression to the mean create betting opportunities with a potential -15% ROI?",

      "betting_insights": "If the 49ers' red zone efficiency is projected to significantly regress (20%+ decrease), consider shorting their team total (target -15% ROI) and targeting 'under' prop bets on key offensive players. Sustained dominance (less than 5% decrease) opens 'over' opportunities. Watch for line movement based on injury reports."
