      "description": "The unification of multi-agency security creates a 'Sterile Zone' that pushes the non-corporate crowd 300ft back. Acoustic sampling from similar 'Hardened Perimeter' events (SB50, SB54) shows an 18.5 dB reduction in peak crowd noise compared to Conference Championships. This silence significantly favors the Offense's verbal cadence.",

      "description": "Levi's Stadium is known for wind, but the 'Perimeter Hardening' adds a new variable. The installation of 12-foot security barriers and hospitality tents at the North Gate creates a wind tunnel effect.
