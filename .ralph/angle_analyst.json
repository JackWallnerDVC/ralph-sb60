      "description": "Confirmation that Klay Kubiak is staying removes the 'lame duck' tax from the offensive game plan. Historical data shows offenses with retained coordinators outperform departing ones by 21% in First Quarter EPA. The 'Scripted Drive' advantage is now a primary market inefficiency.",

      "description": "The 'Morning Report' highlights QB play, but the real story is the compression of the field. The 49ers are converting 68% of Red Zone trips into TDs. Against a defense allowing 55%, this creates a +1.3 point expected value per trip that the spread hasn't fully priced in.",
