Yo guys. If you are looking for the "official" tailgate experience in the Green Lot, I hope you have $800 and a parking pass that was issued three months ago. For everyone else, the party is in Downtown San Jose.

Specifically, San Pedro Square.

## The Hub
San Pedro Square Market is the de facto headquarters for locals who didn't mortgage their house for a parking spot. It’s an open-air food hall with three bars and about 15 food vendors.

Here is why it works for SB60: It is exactly 6 miles from Levi's Stadium, and it sits directly on the VTA Light Rail line.

## The Timeline
Do not treat this like a normal Sunday.
*   **10:00 AM:** Arrival. The main hall tables will be gone by 10:30 AM.
*   **11:00 AM:** The fire marshal usually starts counting heads at the entrances. If you are late, you are queuing on the sidewalk.
*   **1:30 PM:** This is your hard out. You need to walk two blocks to the **St. James Station** to catch the VTA Green Line (Northbound towards Mountain View).

## The VTA Connection
This is the critical link. The VTA Light Rail drops you off at the Great America station, right in front of the stadium.

The trains will be running on a "Super Bowl Special" schedule, meaning they run every 15 minutes. However, the cars fill up at the downtown stations. If you try to board at St. James at 2:30 PM, you might not squeeze on. Leaving at 1:30 PM puts you at the stadium gates by 2:15 PM, giving you time to clear security before the pre-game flyover.

## The "Old Wagon" Audible
If San Pedro Square Market is at capacity, walk 50 feet down the street to **The Old Wagon Saloon**. They have a back patio that fits about 200 people. It’s less polished, the drinks are stronger, and it’s where the South Bay locals actually hang out while the tourists fight for tables at the Market.

Don't drive to Santa Clara unless you have a pass. Park in the San Pedro garage (it's validated if you buy a drink), hit the Market, and ride the rail.
