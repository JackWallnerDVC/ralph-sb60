Hey neighbors. If you live in the 95054 zip code, specifically north of Highway 101 and west of San Tomas Aquino Creek, your neighborhood is about to become a gated community enforced by the SCPD and the National Guard.

The NFL calls it the "Traffic Management Plan." Locals call it the Lockdown.

## The Vehicle Access Pass (VAP)
Starting Thursday at 6:00 AM, you cannot enter the "Soft Perimeter" without a physical VAP hangtag. Showing your ID with a local address will not work. The checkpoints at Lafayette Street and Agnew Road are staffed by private security contractors who have zero discretion. If you don't have the hangtag, you are parking in Sunnyvale and walking.

## The Hard vs. Soft Zones
You need to know which zone your driveway falls into:

*   **Soft Zone:** Residents with VAPs can enter. This covers the residential blocks north of Tasman.
*   **Hard Zone:** No vehicles allowed, period. This includes the entirety of Tasman Drive from Convention Center to Great America Parkway. If your apartment garage exits onto Tasman, you are trapped. You need to move your car to a friend's place outside the zone by Friday night or you aren't moving it until Monday morning.

## The Delivery Blackout
This is the part nobody warns you about. UberEats, DoorDash, and Amazon drivers do not have VAPs. They will be turned away at the perimeter. If you order food on Super Bowl Sunday, you are walking a mile to the checkpoint to pick it up. Stock your fridge on Wednesday. By Friday, the grocery stores inside the perimeter (like the Target on Coleman) get stripped bare by the influx of security personnel and production crews.

## The Guest Towing Trap
Do not let friends park in your complex's guest spots this weekend. Tow trucks are staged at the Mercado shopping center, and they are aggressive. Property managers have authorized immediate towing for vehicles without resident stickers to prevent fans from using apartments as free parking.

Plan your exits. If you leave the perimeter on Sunday morning, getting back in before kickoff requires navigating a maze of road closures that change hourly.
