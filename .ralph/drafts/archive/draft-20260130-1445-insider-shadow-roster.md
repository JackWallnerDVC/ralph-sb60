While the 53-man active roster is doing interviews at the Moscone Center, a different group of players is already at the practice facility in Santa Clara, taping up.

They are the "Shadow Squad"—the practice squad players tasked with mimicking the opponent for the starting defense. And for Super Bowl 60, their role has never been more critical.

## The Scout Team Reality
Sources inside the facility tell me the coaching staff has designated a specific practice squad receiver to play the role of the opposing team's WR1. This isn't just running routes; this player wears a jersey with the opponent's number and is instructed to mimic their specific release habits and split times.

"We need him to be [Opponent Star] for three days," one positional coach told me. "If he takes a play off, our corners get a false sense of security."

## The Logistics of Being #54
Life for the Shadow Squad is different this week.
*   **Pay:** They are earning their standard weekly rate (approx. $12,500 for most), not the massive Super Bowl winner's share (which is projected to be over $170,000 per player this year).
*   **Hotels:** While starters have single rooms, practice squad players are often doubled up.
*   **The Call-Up:** They must stay within a 30-minute radius of the stadium until 90 minutes before kickoff. If a starter tweaks a hamstring in warmups, the call comes.

## The Silent MVP
The most interesting note I've heard this week: The team has a practice squad quarterback running the opponent's two-minute drill exclusively. He has been studying the opponent's audible signals for two weeks. If the defense gets a stop on Sunday's final drive, the game ball belongs to the guy who isn't even dressing for the game.
