excerpt: "You won't see them in the lobby. You won't see them at the valet. Here is the 'Ghost Floor' protocol keeping the A-list invisible."

I’ve spent the last 48 hours staking out the high-end hotel circuit—The Westin San Jose, the Hyatt Regency, the Signia—and if you’re waiting in the lobby for a glimpse of the A-list, you are wasting your time.

My sources in hospitality security tell me the "Ghost Floor" protocol is in full effect for Super Bowl 60.

## The LLC Camouflage
I reviewed a manifest from a major downtown hotel this morning. On paper, the 14th and 15th floors are fully booked by a generic-sounding firm like "Pacific Rim Logistics" or "Blue Horizon Consulting."

These companies don't exist. They are shell entities created solely to book block rooms for high-profile guests—performers, owners, and dignitaries—without alerting the front desk staff. The housekeeping staff assigned to these floors are vetted by private security details, not the hotel management.

## The "Sysco" Entry
While fans are crowding the valet stand, the real VIPs are entering through the loading docks. I watched a convoy of three black Escalades pull into the service bay of a Santa Clara hotel at 2:00 AM, sandwiched between a laundry truck and a Sysco food delivery.

They aren't using the guest elevators. The security directors have engaged the "fireman's override" on the service elevators. These lifts go from the basement loading dock to the Ghost Floors without stopping, and the buttons are disabled for anyone without a specific key fob.

## The Decoy Departures
Here is the trickiest part. I’m hearing that several security teams are running "decoy departures." They stage a motorcade at the front entrance, complete with police escorts and bustling bodyguards. The paparazzi swarm, the sirens blare, and the cars speed off.

Meanwhile, the actual VIP is walking out a side fire exit into a waiting Toyota Sienna minivan. It’s unglamorous, but in the week of the Super Bowl, anonymity is the ultimate luxury.
