I walked down First Street in San Jose last night and didn't recognize my own city.

Every bar I usually hit on a Thursday has been transformed. Black curtains, bouncers with clipboards, and signs screaming "PRIVATE EVENT" or "VIP ENTRY: $50." It’s the Super Bowl tax, and it’s hitting hard.

If you are looking for a place to grab a drink without financing it, you need to get off the main drag.

## The Sanctuary: The Hut

If you want the real Santa Clara experience, head to **The Hut** on Franklin Street. It’s a historic dive that has survived everything, including the tech boom and the stadium construction.

I checked in with the owner this morning. Their policy for SB60 week?
*   **Cover Charge:** $0.
*   **Reservations:** None.
*   **Beer Price:** Regular price ($7 pints).

It’s going to be packed, but it’s going to be packed with locals and fans who actually know football, not influencers looking for a photo op.

## The "Strip Mall" Secret

Don't sleep on the strip malls. While the hotel bars at the Hyatt and Hilton are charging $22 for a martini, the spots tucked next to the dry cleaners are business as usual.

**Woodhams Lounge** on Stevens Creek Blvd is another safe haven. It’s dark, it’s cash-friendly, and they pour heavy. I saw a group of Chiefs fans in there last night realizing they could buy a round for the whole table for the price of two drinks at the Marriott.

## The Rule of Thumb

Here is my advice for the weekend: If you see a red carpet, turn around. If you see a neon sign that’s buzzing and possibly broken, walk in.

The "official" parties are overrated. The best stories happen in the places where the bartender calls you "honey" and the game is on a TV from 2015.
