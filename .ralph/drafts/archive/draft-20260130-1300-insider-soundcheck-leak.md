The NFL goes to great lengths to keep the halftime show surprise under wraps. They use code names for artists. They rehearse in secret hangars. But they cannot change the laws of physics.

Levi's Stadium is an open bowl. And last night at 2:15 AM, the production team ran a full audio test that woke up half of Santa Clara.

## The Tasman Drive Leak

I spoke with three residents of the **Estancia at Santa Clara** apartment complex, located directly across the street from the stadium. All three independently confirmed hearing a specific track that is not part of the headliner's discography.

"It was unmistakable," one resident told me. "They ran the bridge of 'Levitating' four times in a row to check the bass levels."

This aligns with the "Mystery Guest" prop bet movement we saw in Vegas yesterday afternoon, where odds on **Dua Lipa** making a cameo shortened from +1200 to +450.

## The Decibel War

The late-night rehearsal wasn't just about artistic flow; it was a compliance test. Santa Clara has strict noise ordinances, and while the Super Bowl has a waiver, the production crew was calibrating the "delay towers"—speakers positioned at the back of the field to ensure the sound hits the upper deck at the exact same millisecond as the main stack.

My production source confirmed the timeline: "We had a 45-minute window between the turf settling and the dew point rising where we could run full volume. We took it."

## The Security Perimeter

While the audio leaked, the visuals remained locked down. The stadium bowl was cleared of all non-essential personnel during the test. The "Drone Shield" (which we covered earlier) was active, preventing any aerial snooping.

But you don't need a drone to hear a stadium-grade subwoofer test from a balcony 400 yards away. The secret is out. If you're holding a ticket for the "No Guest" prop bet, tear it up.
