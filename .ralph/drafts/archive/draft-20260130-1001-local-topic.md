If your game plan involves driving down Tasman Drive this week, you aren't driving to the Super Bowl—you're driving into a concrete wall.

The City of Santa Clara just initiated the Phase III lockdown. As of last night, Tasman Drive is fully closed to private vehicles between the Convention Center and Great America Parkway. This isn't a partial lane closure or a detour. They dropped K-rail barriers across the asphalt. The road is gone until February 13.

Your GPS doesn't know this yet. Waze and Google Maps are still showing Tasman as "slow" or "congested" because they detect the VTA trains moving. If you trust the blue line on your phone, you will end up trapped in a checkpoint turnaround, watching brake lights stretch for miles while security waves you away.

## The Rideshare Mirage

Once you hit that wall, your instinct is to grab your phone and call a rideshare. That is exactly where the second trap lies.

The official rideshare drop-off point has been moved to Red Lot 7. If you look at a map, that looks close. In reality, it is a 25-minute walk to the stadium gates through a maze of fencing.

Drivers know this. They are currently cancelling rides if they see a destination pin inside the "Soft Zone" because they know they'll get stuck in the checkpoint filter. I spoke to three drivers this morning who said they are auto-declining anything north of Highway 101. The wait time in the official queue is currently averaging 45 minutes just to get a car assigned.

## The Mercado Hack

Forget the official lots and the frustrated drivers. To beat the perimeter, you need to use the Mercado Hack.

Set your drop-off point for the Mercado Shopping Center on Mission College Blvd. It is outside the security cordon, so drivers can actually get there without fighting the police checkpoints. It completely avoids the Great America Parkway standstill.

Get dropped off near the In-N-Out. Grab a burger if you need fuel. From there, the walk is exactly 18 minutes. It is time-invariant because you aren't fighting cars. You are using the one piece of infrastructure that traffic control can't shut down.

## The Creek Trail Bypass

From Mercado, you connect to the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail. The trail runs below street level, which means it bypasses the "Tasman Crush" entirely.

While the VTA Light Rail is the only motorized vehicle allowed to cross the "Hard Zone" on the surface, the trail cuts right through the security perimeter underground. You walk past the gridlock, past the shouting security guards, and past the confused tourists trying to argue with a concrete barrier.

The trail dumps you out right near Gate C. This gate consistently has shorter lines than the main entrances because it feeds from the parking lots rather than the transit hub.

## The Exit Strategy

Getting in is half the battle, but the real pro move is knowing how to escape when the game ends.

Do not take the official Fan Express Shuttles. They sit in the same traffic as general parking. You will sit on a bus for an hour before you even hit the freeway.

Instead, walk the trail south back to Mercado. By getting that far away from the stadium, you put yourself outside the primary surge pricing geofence. You can get a car in 10 minutes while 60,000 people are fighting for signal at the main gates.

Tasman is a fortress until mid-February. Don't try to breach it. Go under it.
