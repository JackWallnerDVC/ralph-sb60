Hey, you think the receiver who catches the winning touchdown gets to keep the ball? Not a chance.

Standing quietly on the sidelines of Levi's Stadium this Sunday will be a small team of people wearing neutral-colored vests and carrying specialized scanning wands. These are the Authenticators, and they have more authority over the game's physical objects than the team owners.

## The Invisible DNA
Before kickoff, every single game ball—including the "K-Balls"—is marked with a synthetic DNA ink that is invisible to the naked eye but reactive to a specific laser frequency. This isn't just about preventing counterfeits; it's about chain of custody.

The pylons are tagged. The coin is tagged. Even the players' jersey patches have unique identifiers embedded in the stitching.

## The Canton Claim
The primary "aggressor" on the sideline is the representative from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They have a pre-printed "Watch List" of potential records that could fall.

*   First touchdown? They want the ball.
*   MVP performance? They want the jersey.
*   Record-breaking sack? They want the gloves.

I’ve witnessed heated arguments in the tunnel where a player refuses to hand over his cleats because he promised them to his mom, while a Hall of Fame curator politely explains that the cleats belong to "history." History usually wins.

## The Auction Economy
For items not destined for Canton, the NFL has a lucrative partnership with auction houses. If a ball is spiked into the stands, security is trained to retrieve it—not to be mean to the fan, but because that ball is a $50,000 asset.

If you catch a ball at SB60, expect a visit from a suit within 30 seconds. They will offer you a trade: a bag of generic swag and a signed photo in exchange for the game ball. If you refuse, they can't legally take it (usually), but they will refuse to authenticate it. Without that holographic sticker applied on the spot, your million-dollar souvenir is just a used football.
