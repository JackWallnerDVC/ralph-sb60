The public money is pouring in on the quarterbacks for Super Bowl 60 MVP. As of 14:00 ET, the implied probability for a QB winning the award sits at **58.3% (-140)**.

If we look at the last 20 Super Bowls, quarterbacks have won 12 times (60%). On the surface, the Vegas line looks efficient.

However, if you isolate for games with this specific spread profile (games with a spread under 3.5 points and a total under 47), the QB win rate drops to **41%**.

## The Defensive Variance
In tight, defensive struggles—which the metrics suggest SB60 will be—the MVP voting bloc tends to reward game-breaking defensive plays over efficient-but-unspectacular quarterback play.

*   **The Edge Rusher Metric:** The 49ers' defensive front has a pressure rate of 38% this postseason. If they record 4+ sacks, the odds of a defensive MVP skyrocket.
*   **The Value Play:** Look at the edge rushers. You are getting **+1600 to +2500** on players who have a legitimate path to wrecking the game script.

## The WR Volume Trap
Avoid the WR1s. In the last five Super Bowls, the WR1 has been double-bracketed on 65% of snaps. The volume goes to the slot receiver or the TE.
*   **Stat to Watch:** Target share in the "Gold Zone" (inside the 20). The tight ends in this matchup have a 28% target share in the red zone, compared to 18% for the wideouts.

**Conclusion:** Fade the QBs at current prices. The math favors a defensive outlier or a high-volume safety valve (TE/RB).
