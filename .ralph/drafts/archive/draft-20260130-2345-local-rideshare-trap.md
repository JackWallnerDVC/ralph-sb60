Sup neighbors,

Do not, under any circumstances, try to get an Uber or Lyft from **Red Lot 7**.

The NFL and the City of Santa Clara have set up a "Rideshare Geofence." If you open your app within 1.5 miles of the stadium, it will force your pickup location to Red Lot 7.

## The Red Lot Reality
Red Lot 7 is a gravel patch located near the golf course. It is a logistical nightmare.
1.  **The Signal Blackout:** With 20,000 people trying to summon cars in one spot, the cell towers overload. You will see your driver on the map, but you won't be able to message them.
2.  **The Gridlock:** Drivers have to wait in a single-file line to enter the lot. I talked to a driver yesterday who spent 45 minutes just *entering* the lot to pick up a passenger.
3.  **The Cancellation:** Because of the delay, drivers frequently cancel on you while they are 100 feet away to grab a surge fare outside the lot.

## The Mercado Maneuver
Locals know the geofence ends at the Great America Parkway overpass.

Here is the play:
1.  Exit the stadium and head **West** on Tasman Drive.
2.  Walk past the Convention Center.
3.  Keep walking until you hit the **Mercado Shopping Center** (where the AMC and In-N-Out are).

It is a 20-minute walk (about 1.1 miles).

## Why It Works
The Mercado lot is just outside the geofence restriction.
*   **Instant Connection:** You are off the stadium cell tower and onto the Mission College towers.
*   **Driver Availability:** Smart drivers hang out in the Mercado parking lot waiting for the surge to spike, but they avoid the Red Lot trap. They are literally sitting there waiting for you.
*   **The Price Drop:** By walking that mile, you often drop the "Event Surcharge," saving $40-$60 on the ride home.

Grab a burger at In-N-Out, wait for the traffic to die down, and ride home in peace.
