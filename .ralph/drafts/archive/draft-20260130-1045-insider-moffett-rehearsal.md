If you live in Sunnyvale or Mountain View, you’ve likely heard the bass thumping from Moffett Federal Airfield over the last three nights.

Social media is already flooding with "leaked" setlists based on what people are hearing over the fence. I’m here to tell you: **It’s all fake.**

## The "Silent Disco" Rehearsal

I spoke with a production audio tech working the site at Hangar 2. He confirmed that the NFL is running a counter-intelligence operation to protect the halftime show reveal.

The music blasting over the PA system—currently a mix of old Bruno Mars tracks and generic high-BPM EDM—is a decoy loop. It is designed specifically to confuse parabolic microphones and casual listeners.

The *actual* rehearsal is happening in what they call "Silent Mode."
*   **The Artist:** Is performing with In-Ear Monitors (IEMs).
*   **The Band:** Is plugged directly into the mixing board.
*   **The PA:** Is playing the decoy track at 105 decibels to mask any bleed from the stage.

## The Drone Shield

The paranoia is justified. On Tuesday night, security spotted three unauthorized commercial drones attempting to hover over the Bay Trail perimeter near the airfield.

The response was immediate.
1.  **The TFR:** The FAA has activated a Temporary Flight Restriction over Moffett Field, citing "National Defense" (convenient, given the airfield's military history).
2.  **Signal Jammers:** My source tells me the production security team is using handheld drone countermeasures (likely DroneShield or similar tech) to force-land unauthorized UAVs.

## The 6-Minute Drill

The real secret being rehearsed isn't the song list; it's the "Stage Drive."

The stage for SB60 is segmented into 24 autonomous carts. They have exactly 6 minutes to drive onto the field, lock together, and power up. At Moffett, they have taped out the exact dimensions of the Levi's Stadium turf. They aren't practicing the singing; they are practicing the driving.

So if you hear "Uptown Funk" blasting at midnight tonight, don't bet on it. It's just noise to cover the real show.
