Hey neighbors. If you're taking the VTA Light Rail to the Super Bowl, you're making the smart choice—until the fourth quarter ends. Then you're entering the Thunderdome.

With roughly 25,000 fans trying to board trains at the Great America station simultaneously, the queue can stretch back to the Convention Center. I’ve seen people wait two hours for a train that takes 15 minutes.

Here is how you beat the system.

## The "Old Ironsides" Backdoor
This is the golden rule for anyone heading East (towards Milpitas, San Jose, or Alum Rock).

The Green and Orange lines run West-to-East. They stop at **Old Ironsides** *before* they hit the mob scene at Great America.

Instead of fighting the crowd at the main gate, walk 10 minutes west along Tasman Drive to the Old Ironsides station. You will walk onto an empty train, grab a seat, and watch comfortably as the doors open at Great America and the crush begins. The security perimeter allows pedestrian flow on Tasman, so this walk is open.

## The Mountain View Problem
If you're heading West (towards Mountain View to catch Caltrain), the "upstream" station is Lick Mill. That is a long walk (nearly a mile) and often not worth it.

Your best bet? Don't rush the exit. The VTA surges trains every 5-10 minutes, but the bottleneck is the platform safety metering. Hang back at the Bourbon Pub or the Hilton Santa Clara lobby for 45 minutes. Let the first wave clear out.

## The Clipper Catastrophe
Do not rely on the Clipper mobile app or the ticket vending machines at the station post-game.
1.  **Cell Service:** When 70,000 people try to upload Instagram stories, the towers throttle. Your app won't load to tag on.
2.  **Machines:** There are only a handful of machines and the lines are insane.

Load your round-trip fare ($5) onto your card or phone *before* you leave your house. If you don't have fare loaded, the fare inspectors (who are out in force) will pull you off the train at the next stop.

## The "Express" Trap
Watch the headsigns. VTA runs "Express" trains that skip stops to move bulk crowds to major hubs. If you live in a smaller neighborhood stop like Vienna or Reamwood, make sure you aren't getting on a bullet train to Milpitas.
