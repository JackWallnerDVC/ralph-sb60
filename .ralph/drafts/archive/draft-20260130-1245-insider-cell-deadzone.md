excerpt: "The stadium Wi-Fi is bulletproof, but the parking lot is a different story. Interference from Moffett Field has compromised the temporary cell towers, creating a digital dead zone for tailgaters."

Everyone is worried about the Wi-Fi capacity inside the bowl. The real problem is outside, and it’s invisible.

I’ve learned that network engineers from the major carriers are scrambling this morning after a critical failure in the "densification" plan for the Levi's Stadium parking lots.

## The COW Failure

To handle the 70,000 fans tailgating and arriving, carriers deployed 12 COWs (Cells on Wheels)—portable cell towers—to blanket the perimeter.

During a full-load stress test yesterday afternoon, three of the units covering **Blue Lot 1** and **Green Lot 3** went offline. They didn't crash due to volume; they crashed due to noise.

## The Moffett Factor

Levi's Stadium sits just a few miles from Moffett Federal Airfield. My sources tell me that the radar arrays at Moffett are creating "harmonic interference" with the specific 5G mid-band spectrum the carriers tuned the COWs to use.

"It's bleeding over," a network architect told me on background. "We’re seeing signal degradation of 40% in the north lots. The military radar is just shouting louder than our towers."

Engineers are currently trying to re-tune the equipment to a lower frequency, but that comes with a cost: significantly lower bandwidth.

## The Ticket Warning

This isn't just about not being able to post to Instagram. It’s about getting into the game.

If the data network in the parking lots collapses under the load—which looks likely—fans trying to pull up their tickets at the gate are going to face the "spinning wheel of death."

**The Fix:** Download your tickets to your Apple Wallet or Google Pay **right now**, while you are on hotel Wi-Fi.

Do not rely on the app loading at the gate. If the Blue Lot goes dark, you’re going to be the person holding up the line while 500 angry fans wait behind you.
