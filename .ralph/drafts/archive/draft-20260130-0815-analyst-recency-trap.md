excerpt: "The public is chasing the blowout performance from Sunday. Historical data shows that teams coming off 20+ point Conference Championship wins are historically overvalued in the Super Bowl market."

The betting public has the memory of a goldfish.

Right now, 72% of the tickets are on the Favorite. Why? Because everyone just watched them dismantle their opponent by 24 points in the Conference Championship. It was a dominant, flashy performance that looks great on highlight reels.

**The sportsbooks know this. They are taxing you for it.**

## The "Blowout Bias" in Historical Data

I ran the numbers on the last 25 Super Bowls. Specifically, I looked at how teams performed against the spread (ATS) after winning their Conference Championship game by more than 14 points.

The results are ugly for the public:

*   **ATS Record:** 6-13 (31.5%)
*   **Average Spread Inflation:** +1.8 points
*   **Straight Up Win Rate:** 48%

The market consistently overvalues the team coming off a "perfect" game. The logic is simple: the public assumes that peak performance is the new baseline. Statistical regression tells us it is an outlier.

## The "Battle-Tested" Variable

Conversely, the Underdog is coming off a gritty, 3-point win that came down to the final possession. They looked vulnerable. They looked beatable.

But in the Super Bowl, "vulnerable" often translates to "prepared."

Teams that won their Conference Championship by 3 points or less cover the Super Bowl spread at a **62% clip**. They are accustomed to high-leverage situations. They have been playing playoff football for four quarters; the Favorite has been coasting since the third quarter of last week.

## The Implied Value

The current line sits at **-4.5**.

My model, which strips out the "recency bias" of the last game and focuses on season-long DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) and EPA (Expected Points Added), makes this line **-2.1**.

You are paying a 2.4-point "tax" to bet on the Favorite right now.

*   **The Play:** Wait. The public money will likely push this to -5 or -5.5 by the weekend.
*   **The Target:** If the line hits +6, the Underdog becomes a maximum value play.

Don't pay for last week's performance. Buy next week's regression.
