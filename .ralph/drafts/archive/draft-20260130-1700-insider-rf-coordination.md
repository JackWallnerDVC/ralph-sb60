While the defensive coordinators are worrying about coverage shells, the most intense battle at Levi's Stadium is happening in the invisible spectrum. I just left a briefing with the NFL's Event Frequency Coordination (EFC) team, and the numbers are staggering.

## The Spectrum Crunch
Super Bowl 60 is officially the most congested RF (Radio Frequency) environment in sports history. We are talking about 12,000 distinct frequencies being managed simultaneously. This includes:
*   Coach-to-player headsets (encrypted, prioritized)
*   Referee mics
*   150+ broadcast cameras
*   Halftime show in-ear monitors
*   Security radios
*   Medical staff comms

The EFC has divided the stadium into "Spectrum Zones." If you walk from the press box to the field, your wireless mic might stop working because you crossed a zone boundary without authorization.

## The "RF Police"
The FCC has deployed mobile direction-finding units—unmarked white vans with rotating antenna arrays on the roof—around the Santa Clara perimeter. Inside the stadium, teams of "RF Police" are walking the sidelines with handheld spectrum analyzers.

I watched them tag a rogue news crew from a local affiliate this morning. The crew turned on a wireless mic that wasn't in the database. Within 45 seconds, an EFC agent was tapping the cameraman on the shoulder. The penalty isn't a warning; it's immediate confiscation of the gear and revocation of credentials.

## The Coach Comms Priority
The nightmare scenario for the league is a headset failure during a two-minute drill. To prevent this, the coach-to-player communication system is operating on a proprietary band with a "guard band" of silence on either side.

I'm told the league has installed new localized jamming beacons near the benches. These aren't military-grade jammers, but "noise floor elevators" that prevent consumer devices (like fans' hotspots) from bleeding into the coaching frequencies. If you are in the front row behind the 49ers bench and your Wi-Fi sucks, that is not an accident. It is a feature.
