excerpt: "Everyone bets the QB for Super Bowl MVP. But the math suggests the real value lies in a specific type of Wide Receiver. Here is the 33% rule."

The betting public has a fundamental bias: they want to see points, and they assume the Quarterback is the reason for them. Since 2000, quarterbacks have won the MVP award 14 times.

However, from a Value Over Replacement (VOR) betting perspective, the QB odds are often crushed into unbettable territory.

The inefficiency in the market lies with the **Wide Receiver**. My analysis of the last 25 Super Bowls reveals a specific statistical signature for WRs who take home the trophy.

## The 33% Threshold

When we look at recent WR winners like Cooper Kupp (LVI), Julian Edelman (LIII), and Santonio Holmes (XLIII), a clear pattern emerges regarding **Target Share**.

To win MVP, a receiver does not just need a "good game." They need to be the entire engine of the offense.
*   **Kupp:** 10 targets (30% share), 2 TDs.
*   **Edelman:** 12 targets (34% share), 141 yards.
*   **Holmes:** 9 targets (39% share in a low-volume passing game).

The data suggests a "Golden Threshold" of **33%**. If a receiver commands one-third of their quarterback's attempts, their correlation to the team's win probability spikes higher than the quarterback's own efficiency metrics.

## The "Funnel Offense" Indicator

This week, do not just look at yards per game. Look at the **distribution variance**.

We are looking for "Funnel Offenses"—teams where the gap between the WR1 and WR2 target share is greater than 15%. If the ball is being spread around (a "flat distribution"), the QB wins MVP by default because the credit is diluted.

If the offense funnels through one guy, and that guy hits the 33% target share mark, the voters (and the stats) reward the receiver.

## The Running Back Fade

Conversely, the data screams to fade the Running Back. An RB has not won Super Bowl MVP since Terrell Davis in 1998. Even with massive performances, the modern game's mechanics heavily discount rushing production unless it exceeds 150 yards and 2+ touchdowns.

**The Play:** Identify the WR1s remaining in the playoffs with a >30% target share over the last 4 weeks. If their MVP odds are longer than +1200, that is a mathematical overlay.
