On Thursday night, residents near Levi's Stadium will hear music. It will be loud. It will be generic. And it will be a lie.

## The Audio Camo Protocol
The NFL's production team has declared war on drone spies and parking lot eavesdroppers. To protect the surprise of the halftime setlist, they are deploying "Audio Camo" during the full dress rehearsals.

While the headliner is on stage performing the actual set, the stadium PA system blasts a loop of "Pink Noise" mixed with heavy bass tracks and generic rock instrumentals.

## How It Works
The artist and the dancers rely entirely on IEMs (In-Ear Monitors).
*   **Vocals:** The microphones are live but routed only to the broadcast truck and the IEMs. They are muted in the stadium house mix.
*   **Instruments:** Guitars and keyboards go direct (DI). There are no amplifiers on stage to generate noise.
*   **Drums:** The kit is electronic or heavily dampened with mesh heads, with triggered samples going to the ears.

## The Decoy Tracks
Security logs indicate that during last year's rehearsal, the production truck played a recorded Red Hot Chili Peppers track on the main speakers while the actual performer (Usher) was rehearsing "Yeah!" on the silent stage.

If you are standing in the Red Lot trying to record a snippet for TikTok, all you will record is a wall of distorted bass and a decoy track. The only people who hear the real show before Sunday are the ones wearing the radio packs.
