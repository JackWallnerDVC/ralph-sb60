Listen up. If you're standing in line at Fisherman's Wharf hoping to see a starting quarterback, you're in the wrong zip code. The 49ers don't hang out in San Francisco, and neither do the visiting teams during the week.

The center of gravity for the NFL elite this week is Santana Row in San Jose. It's a manufactured European-style luxury district, and for the next 72 hours, it's the highest concentration of wealth in the Bay Area.

## The Hotel Valencia Fortress
The Hotel Valencia is the anchor. It's where the agents, the network executives, and the players who aren't on lockdown stay. Security here is tight. You won't get into the lobby without a room key or a wristband, but the courtyard bar (Vbar) spills out onto the balcony. If you're walking on the street below, look up. That's where the deals are happening.

## The "See and Be Seen" Spots
There are two main patios you need to know about: **LB Steak** and **Straits**.
LB Steak is the power lunch spot. I walked by yesterday and saw three different agents working phones while nursing $28 cocktails. If you want a table here for dinner, you're already too late unless you know the maitre d' personally.
Straits is louder, younger, and where the entourage hangs out.

## The Parking Trap
Do not drive down Olin Avenue. It's a gridlock of black SUVs and confused Ubers. The "Winchester" parking garage fills up by 4:00 PM.
Here's the local hack: Park across the street at the Westfield Valley Fair mall. It's a short walk across Stevens Creek Boulevard, and you avoid the hour-long exit queue that plagues the Row garages on Friday nights.

## The Price of Admission
Santana Row isn't cheap. During Super Bowl week, the "tourist tax" is in full effect. Valet pricing has surged to $60 flat rate at some stands. Drinks are pouring at New York City prices. But if you want to see the spectacle—the Lamborghinis, the paparazzi, and the actual NFL ecosystem—this is the arena. Just dress the part. Jerseys are fine, but this crowd leans towards designer hoodies and five-figure watches.
