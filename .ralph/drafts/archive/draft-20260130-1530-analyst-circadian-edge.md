In a game decided by milliseconds, biology is a betting variable.

Super Bowl LX kicks off at 3:30 PM local time in Santa Clara. For the NFC Champions (West Coast based), this is peak physiological arousal time. For the AFC Champions (East Coast based), their internal body clocks will be hitting 6:30 PM by kickoff and nearly 10:00 PM by the fourth quarter.

## The Reaction Time Decay

Stanford sleep researchers have tracked NFL performance relative to circadian rhythms for a decade. The data is stark:
*   **West Coast teams playing at home in the afternoon:** 100% baseline reaction time.
*   **East Coast teams playing on the West Coast in the evening:** 94% baseline reaction time.

A 6% drop sounds negligible. It isn't. The average time to throw in the NFL is 2.7 seconds. A 6% delay in offensive tackle reaction time off the snap equates to 0.16 seconds—literally the difference between a clean pocket and a strip-sack.

## The Acclimatization Myth

"But they've been here all week," is the common counter-argument.

Physiologically, the human body adjusts its circadian rhythm by approximately one hour per day. The AFC team arrived on Sunday evening. By kickoff, they will have had exactly six days to adjust a three-hour time difference.

However, "Media Night" and early morning practice slots disrupt this adjustment. The AFC team has been waking up at 6:00 AM Pacific (9:00 AM Body Clock) for media availability, preventing them from fully shifting their sleep cycles. They are effectively operating in a state of "social jetlag."

## The Fourth Quarter Fade

The most telling metric appears in the fourth quarter of West Coast Super Bowls.
*   **SB50 (Santa Clara):** The Panthers (East Coast) were outscored 14-0 in the fourth quarter.
*   **SB56 (Inglewood):** The Bengals (East Coast) gave up the game-winning drive in the final minutes.

When fatigue sets in, the team fighting their biological clock loses cognitive sharpness faster. If SB60 is close entering the fourth quarter, the live betting edge heavily favors the team whose bodies aren't screaming for sleep.

Watch the AFC offensive line in the final 15 minutes. If you see false starts or slow get-offs, that's not nerves. That's biology.
