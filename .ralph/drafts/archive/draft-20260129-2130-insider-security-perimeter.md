If you thought getting into Levi's Stadium was tight during the playoffs, you haven't seen anything yet.

**I've seen the maps.** The security perimeter—what the ops teams call the "Iron Ring"—is expanding significantly for Super Bowl 60.

## The Hard Perimeter

Sources tell me the hard perimeter (the point where no unauthorized vehicles can pass) is being pushed back an extra 300 feet compared to standard NFL operations.

Concrete barriers are already being staged in the overflow lots. I'm hearing that starting next Tuesday, Tasman Drive will be completely locked down. If you don't have a Level 1 credential or a resident pass, you aren't getting within a half-mile of the stadium gates.

## The Federal Layer

This is a SEAR 1 event (Special Event Assessment Rating), meaning the Secret Service is the lead agency.

**What I'm hearing on the ground:**
*   **K-9 Units:** The number of dog teams has doubled. They are sweeping delivery trucks at an off-site remote screening facility (RSF) located nearly 5 miles away before escorting them in.
*   **Airspace:** The FAA Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is going to be stricter this year. I'm told the "No Drone Zone" enforcement technology has been upgraded. If you fly a drone near Santa Clara during game week, they *will* take control of it.

## Credential Chaos?

One logistical whisper to keep an eye on: The media credential pickup center has been moved. It's usually near the stadium. This year? It's miles away at the Convention Center.

The league wants to minimize foot traffic near the venue. It's going to be a fortress.
