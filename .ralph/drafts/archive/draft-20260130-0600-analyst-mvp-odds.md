excerpt: "Significant movement in the Super Bowl MVP market this morning. The money is moving away from the quarterbacks."
---

The Super Bowl MVP award is typically a quarterback's trophy to lose. In the last 20 years, QBs have won it 14 times.

However, the early money for Super Bowl 60 is telling a different story.

## The Money vs. The Tickets

I'm tracking a significant divergence at major sportsbooks between the ticket count (public perception) and the handle (total money wagered/sharps).

*   **NFC Quarterback:** 35% of tickets, but only 18% of the money.
*   **NFC Pass Rusher (Edge):** 8% of tickets, but **22% of the money**.

## Why the Shift?

Smart money is likely reacting to the offensive line mismatch I highlighted yesterday. The AFC's pass block win rate (PBWR) ranks 28th in the league since Week 15.

If the game script follows the "defensive struggle" model projected by the low Over/Under (currently 44.5), the path for a defensive MVP becomes viable.

## Historical Context

Defensive players have won Super Bowl MVP only 10 times in history. However, 4 of those came in games where the total score was under 40 points.

**The Value Play:** The implied probability of a defensive winner is currently priced at 12% (+750). My model puts the actual probability closer to 18% given the matchup metrics.
