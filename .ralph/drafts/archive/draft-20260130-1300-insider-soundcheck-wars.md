If you live within a mile of Levi's Stadium, you might have noticed a low-frequency hum starting around 11:00 PM last night.

Residents in the Miraval condos took to Nextdoor to complain about "construction noise."

My sources confirm it isn't construction. It is **Audio Masking**.

## The White Noise Wall

The NFL is deploying a localized audio counter-measure system to protect the secrecy of the Halftime Show rehearsals.

Here is how it works:
*   **Directional Arrays:** Banks of speakers are positioned on the upper concourse, facing *outward* toward the surrounding neighborhoods.
*   **Pink Noise:** They blast a specific frequency spectrum (Pink Noise) designed to mask the dynamic range of music. It scrambles the audio for anyone trying to record from a balcony or a drone.

This is standard operating procedure for the Super Bowl, but the proximity of residential housing to Levi's Stadium (less than 400 yards in some spots) has forced the league to crank the volume.

## The Wind Shear Leak

Despite the tech, the system failed briefly at 12:15 AM.

The "Levi's Variable"—the same wind currents that mess with kickers—created a pocket of clear air. Sustained winds of 15 mph from the Northwest disrupted the masking frequencies.

For about 90 seconds, the audio shield dropped.

I won't spoil the setlist here, but multiple sources on Tasman Drive reported hearing a very distinct, heavy brass section. This aligns with the rumors of a "Funk/Soul" surprise guest that have been circulating in the production trailers all week.

## Security Response

The leak has triggered a scramble. I'm hearing that NFL Security is expanding the "Quiet Zone" perimeter tonight.

They are pushing the physical pedestrian barriers back another 200 feet on the North side to ensure that even if the audio masking fails, handheld recording devices will be out of range.

If you are planning to hang out on the Great America bike path tonight to catch a free concert: don't bother. You'll just hear static.
