The 49ers are playing in Super Bowl 60. They are playing at Levi's Stadium. But they are not the "Home" team.

In a twist of NFL bureaucracy that is driving the team's equipment staff crazy, the 49ers have been ordered to vacate the home locker room by Friday at 12:00 PM.

## The Even-Year Curse

Per the NFL's Game Operations Manual, the "Home Team" designation for the Super Bowl rotates annually between the conferences.
*   **Odd Super Bowls:** NFC is Home.
*   **Even Super Bowls:** AFC is Home.

Super Bowl 60 is an even-numbered game. Therefore, the AFC Champion is the designated Home Team.

This means the AFC representative gets the choice of jersey color (they chose white, interestingly) and, more importantly, the keys to the host stadium's primary locker room.

## The "Neutral Site" Fiction

"It's surreal," a facility operations source told me this morning. "We are currently taping over the 49ers logos in the main hallway. We have to treat Levi's like a neutral site, even though the Niners are playing here."

The 49ers will occupy the Visiting Locker Room—a space designed specifically to be less comfortable than the home side. It is smaller, has fewer medical tables, and the lockers are six inches narrower.

## The Logistics of Eviction

The move is not symbolic; it is physical. I watched three equipment trucks idling in the loading dock this morning. They aren't going to the airport; they are moving gear 400 feet down the hallway.

The 49ers have to clear out everything: personal items, nutrition stations, and the massive hydrotherapy tubs that are permanently installed in the home suite. The AFC team will bring in their own branding, effectively colonizing the 49ers' headquarters for the week.

"Kyle [Shanahan] isn't happy," the source added. "But he's using it. 'They are kicking you out of your house.' It's a hell of a motivation tactic."
