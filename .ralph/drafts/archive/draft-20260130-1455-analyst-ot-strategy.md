If Super Bowl 60 goes to overtime, the most important decision of the night will happen at midfield before a snap is played. And if the winning captain says "We want the ball," they are statistically wrong.

The ghost of Super Bowl LVIII looms over this analysis. The 49ers took the ball, kicked a field goal, and then watched Patrick Mahomes use four-down territory to drive for the winning touchdown.

## The Information Asymmetry
Under the current NFL playoff overtime rules (amended 2022), both teams are guaranteed a possession unless the first team's defense scores a safety. This changes the calculus entirely from the "Sudden Death" era.

The team that goes second possesses a massive strategic advantage: **Information**.

1.  **The First Offense:** Must play conservative on 4th-and-medium from their own 40, because a turnover on downs gives the opponent a short field to win with a field goal. They are effectively playing 3-down football.
2.  **The Second Offense:** Knows exactly what they need. If the first team scored a TD, the second team knows they *must* score a TD. This unlocks 4th down everywhere on the field. They are playing 4-down football.

## The 4th Down Equity
Analytics models show that having four downs to convert a series increases the probability of scoring a touchdown by approximately 18-22% compared to a three-down series.

By kicking off, you force the opponent to play a standard, conservative drive. If you hold them to a punt or a field goal, your offense takes the field with four downs at their disposal to either match (and extend) or win.

## The Fatigue Factor
There is a secondary variable: Defense fatigue. The team that kicks off puts their defense on the field immediately after the end of regulation. However, if that defense gets a stop, the offense comes out against a defense that has just rested during the coin toss and the first drive.

Despite this, the math on "Information Advantage" is overwhelming. In SB60, the correct call is to defer. Let's see if the coaches trust the spreadsheet or the tradition.
