Hey, think you own your storefront? Not this week.

If you are within the "Clean Zone"—a 300-foot radius around Levi's Stadium enforced by Santa Clara ordinance—you do not exist unless you are a Tier 1 sponsor.

## The Tape Team
I just watched a crew of four NFL operations staff move through the loading dock area with rolls of silver gaffer tape. Their job is specific: cover any logo that isn't Visa, Verizon, or Pepsi.

They taped over the branding on a forklift. They taped over the manufacturer's logo on a portable generator. I even saw them tape over the logo on a security guard's personal thermos. This is the "Tape Team," and they are the ground troops of the NFL's billion-dollar exclusivity contracts.

## The Ambush Marketing War
The league is paranoid about "ambush marketing"—where a non-sponsor tries to get camera time.

Inside the locker room, the enforcement is even stricter. Players have been warned that wearing non-approved headphones (Beats, Sony) during warmups or post-game interviews will result in a $10,000 fine. The only logo allowed on a headset is Bose.

## The "Surface" Rule
On the sidelines, the branding is engineered down to the millimeter. The Microsoft Surface tablets used for play review are positioned so the logo faces the camera. If a player throws a tablet in frustration (we're looking at you, quarterbacks), there is a protocol to immediately swap it out, ensuring a broken screen doesn't become a viral meme associated with the sponsor.

## The Local Impact
For local businesses on Tasman Drive, the Clean Zone means they cannot display temporary banners or "Welcome Fans" signs unless they are generic. A pizza shop near the perimeter was told to take down a "Super Bowl Special" sign because they used the words "Super Bowl" (trademarked) instead of "The Big Game."

The NFL doesn't just rent the stadium. They occupy the zip code.
