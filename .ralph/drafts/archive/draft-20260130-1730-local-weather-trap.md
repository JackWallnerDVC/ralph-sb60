excerpt: "Don't let the 3:30 PM sunshine fool you. By the third quarter, Levi's Stadium turns into a wind tunnel. Here is the layer strategy you need."

I see it every time the 49ers play a primetime game. Fans fly in from the East Coast, check the weather app—"65 degrees and sunny"—and head to the stadium in a t-shirt.

By the third quarter, they are huddled in the concourse buying a $120 hoodie just to stop shivering.

## The Microclimate Reality

Levi's Stadium is in Santa Clara, not Los Angeles. We are close to the Bay.

Super Bowl 60 kicks off at 3:30 PM local time. It will be beautiful.
But the sun sets at 5:28 PM.

Once the sun drops behind the luxury suites, the temperature plummets. We are talking a 15-20 degree swing in 60 minutes. Plus, the stadium design tends to funnel wind through the open corners.

## The "Shiver Factor"

It’s not just the temperature (likely low 50s); it’s the dampness. The marine layer rolls in, and 52 degrees here feels colder than 40 degrees in a dry climate.

If you are sitting in the **400 Level** or the upper rows of the **200 Level**, you are fully exposed to the wind.

## The Strategy

Do not be the tough guy.

1.  **Bring a Beanie:** It fits in your pocket. You will want it at halftime.
2.  **The Light Puffer:** Uniqlo-style down jackets are perfect. They scrunch up into nothing when it's sunny, but save your life when the fog rolls in.
3.  **No Sandals:** I shouldn't have to say this, but I see it constantly. Concrete radiates cold. Wear real socks.

Enjoy the California sun during the pre-game. But respect the Bay Area night.
