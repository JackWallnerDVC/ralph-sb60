While the fans are watching the practice field, the real action is happening in the empty meeting rooms. Sources confirm that both Super Bowl teams have hired private Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures (TSCM) firms to supplement standard NFL security.

This isn't just checking for hidden cameras. This is industrial espionage defense.

## The 4:00 AM Sweep

Every morning at 4:00 AM, three hours before the first staff member arrives, a team of four specialists sweeps the team facility. They are using Non-Linear Junction Detectors (NLJDs)—devices that look like futuristic metal detectors capable of identifying semiconductor junctions.

Why does this matter? An NLJD can detect a recording device or transmitter *even if it is turned off and has no battery*. You can't hide a bug in the drywall anymore.

## The RF Spectrum War

The team hotels are even more chaotic. I'm told one team's security director has banned all "smart" devices from the strategy rooms. No Apple Watches, no Fitbits, and absolutely no wireless headphones.

They are also monitoring the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum in real-time. If a rogue signal spikes in the 2.4GHz or 5GHz range (standard Wi-Fi/Bluetooth frequencies) during a walkthrough, security is alerted immediately.

## The Paranoia Factor

The level of distrust is at an all-time high. One equipment manager was spotted taping over the smoke detectors in the locker room—not to smoke, but because they feared the optical sensors could be hacked to read lip movements. (Fire marshals quickly put a stop to that).

It sounds like a spy novel, but with millions of dollars on the line, nobody is taking chances. The game plan is the most valuable asset in Santa Clara right now, and the walls have ears.
