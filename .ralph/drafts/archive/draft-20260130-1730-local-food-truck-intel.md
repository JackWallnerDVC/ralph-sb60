Stadium food at Super Bowl prices will destroy your wallet. A hot dog shouldn't cost as much as a steak dinner. Here is where to actually eat.

## Outside the Perimeter (But Close)

**Mercado Shopping Center (0.8 miles)**
*   **La Costeña:** Authentic Michoacán-style tacos. $3 each. The al pastor is carved fresh. Open until 10 PM all week.
*   **Madras Cafe:** South Indian dosas and uttapam. Vegetarian-friendly, fast service. $12-15 per person.

**Tasman Drive Corridor (1.2 miles)**
*   **Tung Kee Noodle House:** Vietnamese pho and bun. Hearty bowls for $11-13. Open late.
*   **Dishdash:** Mediterranean platters. The lamb kebab plate feeds two for $18.

## The Food Truck Situation

NFL-contracted vendors get priority parking near the stadium. Local trucks are pushed to the fringes.

Your best bet: The parking lot behind the **Santa Clara Convention Center** (Tasman and Great America Parkway). 6-8 trucks daily during Super Bowl week. Expect longer lines but prices 40% below stadium levels.

## The Grocery Move

**Target (Coleman Avenue):** Stock up Thursday morning. By Friday evening, the shelves get stripped. The store actually brings in extra inventory for Super Bowl week, but it moves fast.

**Safeway (El Camino Real, Santa Clara):** Further from the stadium, better availability. The deli counter does custom sandwich platters with 2-hour notice.

Eat smart. Your credit card will thank you.
