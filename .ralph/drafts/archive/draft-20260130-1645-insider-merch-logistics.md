At this exact moment, there are two pallets of boxes sitting in a secure, climate-controlled cage near the loading dock of Levi's Stadium. One pallet is labeled "SF CHAMPIONS." The other is labeled "AFC CHAMPIONS."

Only one of them will ever see the light of day.

The logistics of the post-game celebration are a high-stress operation run by a specialized NFL "Game Presentation" team. I spoke with a logistics coordinator who walked me through the "Phantom Merchandise" protocol for Sunday.

## The Tunnel C Staging
At the start of the 4th Quarter, regardless of the score, both pallets are moved to a staging area in **Tunnel C**, just off the field. They are guarded by two NFL security representatives and a representative from the merchandise licensee.

The boxes are color-coded with gaffer tape—Red for SF, Silver for the AFC—to prevent a "Steve Harvey" moment where the wrong shirts are handed out in the chaos.

## The "Two-Minute" Drill
The protocol is strict:
*   **If the margin is >14 points:** The winning team's boxes are cut open at the 2:00 minute warning. Runners are positioned at the sideline benches.
*   **If the margin is <7 points:** The boxes remain sealed until the clock hits 0:00.

This is why you sometimes see a delay in players getting their hats in close games. The league would rather have a 30-second delay than risk a camera catching a "Bills Super Bowl Champions" hat on the sideline of a losing team.

## The Destruction Protocol
What happens to the losing team's gear? The old myth is that it gets shipped immediately to developing nations. That hasn't been the primary protocol for years due to the rise of the internet and the secondary market value of "phantom" gear.

I'm told the losing team's pallet is immediately shrink-wrapped in black plastic, loaded onto a dedicated truck, and transported to a secure facility in Nevada. There, under supervision, the merchandise is typically shredded or recycled for textile use. The league's brand protection is ruthless; they do not want a single "49ers Super Bowl LX Losers" shirt appearing on eBay on Monday morning.
