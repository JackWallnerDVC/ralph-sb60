If you turn on a wireless microphone within 500 yards of Levi's Stadium right now without a specific frequency tag, two men in dark polos will find you within three minutes. They will not ask you nicely to turn it off. They will confiscate the battery pack and pull your credentials.

These are the NFL Event Frequency Coordinators (EFC), and they are currently running the tightest wireless spectrum in the world.

## The Invisible Gridlock
Super Bowl 60 isn't just a football game; it is an RF (Radio Frequency) nightmare. Between the referee mics, the coach-to-quarterback headsets, the medical spotters, the halftime show's in-ear monitors, and 120+ international broadcasters, there are over 10,000 active frequencies fighting for space in the air.

To manage this, the NFL has set up an "RF War Room" deep in the bowels of Levi's Stadium.

## The Tagging Protocol
I walked past the media check-in desk this morning and saw the enforcement in action. A cameraman from a local affiliate in Sacramento tried to bring in a standard Sennheiser wireless lavalier kit.

The EFC team stopped him. Every single wireless device entering the perimeter must be tested and "tagged." The tag specifies the exact frequency window (down to the kilohertz) that device is allowed to operate in. If your device doesn't have a tag, it doesn't get in. If it has a tag but drifts outside its lane, the spectrum analyzers pick it up instantly.

## Protecting the QB
The priority, as always, is the game. The coach-to-player communication system (the green dot on the helmet) operates on a secured, encrypted band. But encryption doesn't stop interference.

If a rogue signal from a halftime show lighting rig bleeds into the coach's frequency, the quarterback hears static instead of the play call. To prevent this, the EFC creates a "guard band"—a buffer of empty silence around the game-critical frequencies.

## The Game Day Hunt
On Sunday, teams of "Spectrum Snipers" will roam the sidelines and the stands carrying handheld analyzers. They are looking for unauthorized signals.

The biggest threat? Fans. With the rise of personal hotspots and unauthorized Wi-Fi bridges, the noise floor at Levi's Stadium rises dramatically at kickoff. The EFC has the authority to jam specific consumer bands if they threaten the integrity of the officiating mics or the play-calling system.

The air you breathe is free. The airwaves at the Super Bowl cost millions.
