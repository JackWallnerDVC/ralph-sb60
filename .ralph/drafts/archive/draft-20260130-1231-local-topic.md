If you think you can just order DoorDash to your hotel near Levi's Stadium this week, you are about to go hungry.

The "Clean Zone" is officially in effect. This isn't just about covering up logos or restricting traffic. It has effectively turned the 95054 zip code into a food desert for anyone without a credential.

## The Delivery Blackout
I checked the delivery apps this morning from a friend's apartment on Agnew Road. The interface looks normal. The restaurants show as "Open." You can build your cart and hit pay.

But the food will never arrive.

The "Soft Perimeter" creates a physical barrier that gig workers cannot cross. Drivers for UberEats and DoorDash do not have the required Vehicle Access Pass (VAP) to get past the checkpoints at Tasman Drive or Lafayette Street. I spoke to a driver yesterday who spent forty minutes trying to argue with a private security contractor at the perimeter. He was turned away. The app still charged the service fee.

If you are staying at a hotel inside the zone—like the Hyatt or the Hilton—do not rely on delivery. You will end up walking a mile to the checkpoint to meet a driver who is stuck in traffic.

## The Stadium Price Gouge
Your next thought is probably to just eat inside the stadium. I hope you brought your credit limit.

Concession pricing has been surged specifically for Super Bowl 60. We aren't talking standard NFL prices. A domestic beer is listed at $18. Premium imports are $22. A standard hot dog is $16.

Beyond the price, there is the supply issue. At the last major event here, concession stands ran out of pretzels and chicken tenders by halftime. You are a captive audience, and the logistics of restocking inside the secure perimeter are a nightmare.

## The Clear Bag Trap
Don't try to be a hero and smuggle in a feast. Security at Gate F is enforcing a strict "single-serving" rule for snacks.

I watched them confiscate family-size bags of chips and beef jerky this morning. If the package isn't factory-sealed and single-serving size, it goes in the trash. The clear bag policy makes it impossible to hide anything. The bins at the security checkpoint are already overflowing with food that fans thought they could bring in.

## The Golden Zone: Santa Clara Square
Here is the strategy if you want a real meal. You need to head to **Santa Clara Square**.

This is the shopping center right off Highway 101 at Bowers Avenue. It is the only dining hub that hits the sweet spot: it is accessible by car (outside the hard perimeter) but within walking distance of the stadium.

You have **Il Fornaio**, **Puesto**, and **Fleming's**. Forget about reservations; those were booked months ago. But the patios are open for walk-ins. If you get there by 11:00 AM, you can grab a table. From there, it is a straight 15-minute walk to the stadium gates. You eat real food, pay normal prices, and skip the concession lines.

## The Rivermark Trek
Your backup option is **Rivermark Plaza** on the other side of the stadium. It has a Safeway and more casual spots.

But be warned: the walk is deceptive. To get from Rivermark to Levi's, you have to cross the **Montague Expressway pedestrian bridge**. It looks close on the map, but the bridge and the detours add about 25 minutes to your walk compared to Santa Clara Square. It is a hike.

Don't start your Super Bowl Sunday on an empty stomach. Plan your calories before you hit the checkpoints, or you'll be fighting over the last $16 hot dog in the fourth quarter.
