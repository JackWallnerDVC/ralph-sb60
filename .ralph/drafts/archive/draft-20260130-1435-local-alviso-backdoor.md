Hey,

The traffic map on Super Bowl Sunday will look like a bruised plum—deep purple everywhere around Levi's Stadium. The Great America Parkway exit off 101 will be a parking lot by 10:00 AM.

If you want to skip the two-hour crawl, you need to look north to Alviso.

This tiny neighborhood sits right on the bay, just north of the stadium. It is technically San Jose, but it feels like a different world. The key here is the **San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail**.

Here is the play:

Have your rideshare drop you off near **Vahl's Restaurant** or the **Alviso Marina County Park** on Hope Street. From there, you hop on the trail. It is a paved, flat path that runs directly south along the creek.

The walk is about 1.2 miles. It takes 20 to 25 minutes. You will walk past the water treatment plant (hold your breath if the wind is wrong) and emerge right at the **Toyota Gate F** on the northeast corner of the stadium.

Why this works:

1.  **Traffic Isolation:** Alviso is accessed via Hwy 237 and North 1st Street, avoiding the 101/Great America crush entirely.
2.  **Security Checkpoints:** The pedestrian checkpoints on the trail are often faster than the main plazas because fewer people know this route exists.
3.  **The Exit Strategy:** When the game ends, while everyone is fighting for a spot on the VTA or waiting for a $300 Uber in the Red Lot, you walk back to Alviso. Have your driver meet you at the Marina.

A warning: The trail is unlit in sections. After the game, it will be pitch black. Use your phone light. Also, Alviso is below sea level. If it rains heavily the week before, the trail underpasses can flood. Check the water levels, but if it is dry, this is the only way to beat the gridlock.
