You’ve just watched the Lombardi Trophy presentation. You pull out your phone to call an Uber. You see a message: "Pickups unavailable in this area."

Welcome to the Geofence.

## The Digital Wall
For Super Bowl 60, the SCPD and the NFL have established a digital exclusion zone for rideshare apps. It’s not just that drivers *can't* get to you; the app literally won't let you drop a pin.

The official "Rideshare Zone" is Red Lot 7. Do not go there.
1.  It is a 25-minute walk from the gates.
2.  There is a queue of 4,000 people.
3.  The surge pricing is locked at 5x.

## The Mercado Escape
Locals know that the geofence ends at Mission College Boulevard. The smartest move is to walk away from the stadium, cross the pedestrian bridge over the creek, and head for the **AMC Mercado 20** movie theater.

It is a 15-minute walk (0.8 miles), but the moment you cross the creek, your app will unlock.

## The Driver Psychology
Drivers hate the official lot too. They get stuck in traffic for 40 minutes to pick up one passenger. Smart drivers hang out in the Mercado parking lot or near the In-N-Out Burger, waiting for the surge to hit, but staying outside the gridlock zone.

If you request from the Mercado, you get a driver in 3 minutes who is happy they don't have to fight the police checkpoints. You are on Highway 101 in 5 minutes. The people in Red Lot 7 are still waiting for their driver to enter the lot.
