I walked down Tasman Drive this morning and saw a homeowner spray-painting a sign on a piece of plywood: "PARKING - $250 - NO BLOCKING."

He will get it, too.

The parking situation for Super Bowl 60 has officially gone off the rails. If you are planning to drive to the stadium on Sunday without a pre-paid Green Lot pass (which are currently reselling for $800 on StubHub), you are walking into a trap.

Here is the intel on the parking wars happening in the neighborhoods surrounding the Clean Zone.

## The Driveway Cartel

Residents in the "soft perimeter" (north of 237, south of 101) are cashing in. The going rate for a spot in a private driveway within a 1.5-mile walk of the stadium is hovering between **$200 and $300**.

If you go this route, cash is king, but be careful. I’ve heard reports of homeowners "double booking" spots—taking cash from one driver, then selling the spot again when the first guy leaves for a minute. Make sure you have the key code or a physical claim ticket if they offer one.

## The "Fake Attendant" Scam

This is happening in the office park lots along Great America Parkway. Guys in orange vests are waving cars into private corporate lots, collecting $100 cash, and disappearing.

When you come back after the game, your car won't be there. It will be in an impound lot in San Jose. The tow companies are patrolling these lots aggressively. If the attendant doesn't have a laminated credential around their neck, **keep driving**.

## The Towing Aggression

Speaking of towing, the enforcement is predatory right now. The local tow companies have brought in extra trucks from as far as Sacramento.

Do not park in the shopping centers on North First Street. Do not park at the AMC Mercado unless you are actually seeing a movie (they are checking ticket stubs). The "2 Hour Parking" signs are being strictly enforced with chalk tires and timers.

## The Only Sane Option

I will say it again: **The VTA is your friend.**

Park at the Milpitas BART station garage ($3/day) or the Mountain View Caltrain lot ($5/day). Both have massive capacity and are patrolled by actual security. Take the Orange Line or Green Line light rail directly to the stadium.

You will save $200, you won't get towed, and you won't have to negotiate with a guy holding a spray-painted plywood sign.
