You've just watched the confetti fall at Super Bowl 60. You're buzzing. You pull out your phone to call an Uber to get back to the city.

The app loads. **$185. Arrival in 55 minutes.**

Welcome to the Levi's Stadium Geofence.

## The Red Lot 1 Nightmare

The official rideshare pickup zone is **Red Lot 1**. On a normal Sunday, it's chaotic. On Super Bowl Sunday, it is a parking lot of despair.

The "Event Surge" algorithm is aggressive here. Drivers are stuck in gridlock trying to enter the lot, which drives up wait times and prices. I've seen people wait 90 minutes for a car that cancels on them.

Don't be that guy. Here is how we do it.

## The VTA "North" Hack

The VTA Light Rail station (Great America) is right in front of the stadium. 

90% of the crowd is trying to go South toward San Jose or transfer to Caltrain. Those trains are packed like sardines.

**Go North.**

Hop on the Mountain View line. Take it just two stops to **Lick Mill** or **Old Ironsides**. These are quiet office park stops.
1.  Get off the train.
2.  You are now outside the primary "Event Surge" radius.
3.  Call your Uber from the station parking lot.
4.  The price usually drops back to normal ($30-40 range), and the driver can actually get to you without fighting stadium traffic.

## The "Hyatt" Walk-Out

If you don't want to deal with the train, use your legs.

Walk West on Tasman Drive, past the Convention Center. Your target is the **Hyatt Regency Santa Clara**. It's about a 10-12 minute walk.

The hotel has a massive driveway and a lobby bar.
*   **The Move:** Go inside, use a clean bathroom, and grab a drink.
*   **The Timing:** Wait 20 minutes for the initial rush to clear.
*   **The Pickup:** Order your car from the hotel main entrance. It is much easier for drivers to navigate than the stadium lots.

## Cash is King

One last thing: On the walk to the train or the hotel, you will pass the "Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog" carts. They smell amazing. They are amazing.

They do not take Venmo when the cell towers are jammed. Bring a twenty. You're gonna need the fuel.
