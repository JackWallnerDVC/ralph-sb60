The credential you hang around your neck at Levi's Stadium isn't just ID. It's a caste system.

## The Hierarchy

**Red Field Pass:** Full access. Tunnel, locker rooms, sidelines. About 200 exist. NFL ownership, C-suite execs, and select broadcast talent only.

**Blue Field Pass:** Sideline only. No tunnel, no locker room. Team personnel, credentialed media with field access, and VIP security.

**Yellow Field Pass:** Bench area only. Team staff, medical personnel, equipment managers.

**Green Field Pass:** Field level photography positions only. Designated spots, escorted movement.

## The Black Market

Sources say a Red Field Pass traded for $8,000 on the secondary market last week. The NFL's response: a complete credential reprint on Wednesday, rendering all previous passes invalid.

That's standard protocol. The credential office runs reprints every 48 hours during Super Bowl week. If your pass looks different from yesterday's, that's why.

## The Scanner Trap

Every credential has an embedded RFID chip. Scan points exist at tunnel entrances, elevator banks, and the field itself. Try to tailgate through a door behind someone, and security knows immediately.

The system logs every scan. If your credential shows up in two places within impossible travel time, both locations get flagged.

Your credential isn't permission. It's surveillance.
