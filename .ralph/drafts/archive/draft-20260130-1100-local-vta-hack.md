Yo, listen to me carefully: Do not drive to Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl 60.

I know you rented a nice car. I know you want to tailgate. But unless you have a prepaid parking pass in Red Lot 1 (which you probably don't), driving is a rookie mistake.

## The Tasman Drive Trap

Tasman Drive is the main artery feeding the stadium. On gameday, the security perimeter shuts down lanes starting 4 hours before kickoff. I've seen tourists stuck in their rental cars on Lawrence Expressway for two hours, watching the flyover from their dashboard.

The resale market for stadium parking is currently averaging **$150 to $200** per spot. And that puts you in a satellite lot where you still have to walk 20 minutes.

## The VTA Play

The locals know the cheat code: The **VTA Light Rail**.

Specifically, the **Orange Line** or the **Green Line**. Both drop you off at the **Great America Station**, which is literally right in front of the stadium gates. You can see the field from the platform.

Here is the move:

1.  **Park at the Milpitas BART Station.** The garage is massive, secure, and connects directly to the VTA Orange Line.
2.  **Buy a Day Pass.** It costs **$5.00**. Not $150. Five bucks. You can use the Clipper app on your phone.
3.  **Ride the Orange Line West.** It takes about 15-20 minutes. It drops you at the stadium.

## The "Post-Game" Advantage

Here is the real reason we do this: Leaving.

When the game ends, the parking lots are a gridlock nightmare. It can take 90 minutes just to exit the lot. The VTA lines up trains back-to-back. You hop on, and you are back at your car in Milpitas in 20 minutes, cruising down 880 while everyone else is still honking at each other in Santa Clara.

Save the parking money. Buy a round at the tailgate instead.
