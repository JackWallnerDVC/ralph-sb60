At 15:45 today, a nondescript armored van backed into the loading dock at Levi's Stadium. There was no fanfare, but the security detail was heavier than what we saw for the team buses.

The Vince Lombardi Trophy has officially entered the building.

I spoke with a source on the logistics team who walked me through the "White Glove" protocol that is now in effect until the final whistle on Sunday.

## The Secure Bunker
The trophy is currently housed in a windowless auxiliary locker room near the tunnel, designated as "Secure Zone Alpha." It is guarded 24/7 by two off-duty police officers and a representative from Tiffany & Co., the "Keeper of the Cup."

Only three people have the key card access to this room: The Keeper, the NFL Commissioner, and the Head of Security.

## The Engraving Station
Here is a detail most fans miss: The trophy presentation on the field is just the beginning. The actual engraving happens *at the stadium*, immediately after the game.

I watched the setup crew wheel in the engraving station this afternoon. It’s a mobile workbench equipped with the specific stencils and tools needed to hammer the winning team's name and score onto the silver base. They set this up in the tunnel during the 4th quarter. The moment the game ends, the engraver stands by. They have about 15 minutes to prep the tools while the confetti is flying.

## The Field Path
The path to the podium is already marked with UV-reactive tape on the floor. When the clock hits 0:00, a "wedge" of security guards will form around the Keeper. They have a specific route that avoids the player benches to prevent an accidental collision.

If you see a man in a suit wearing white cotton gloves sprinting down the sideline with a silver object covered in a velvet cloth on Sunday night, that’s not a prop. That’s the $50,000 sterling silver reality.
