I'm hearing whispers that the expanded security perimeter isn't just about physical barriers. New drone detection tech and advanced sensor networks are being deployed to monitor the area. Expect increased surveillance and quicker responses to potential threats.

## Understanding the Expanded Security Perimeter

The security perimeter for Super Bowl LX is expanding beyond physical barriers. I'm told the perimeter extends to 1500 feet from the stadium's outer walls. That's roughly Tasman Drive, Stars and Stripes Drive, Marie P. DeBartolo Way, and Lafayette Street. Within that zone, 47 businesses are directly affected.

New drone detection tech and advanced sensor networks are being deployed. This expansion aims to enhance security and monitor potential threats more effectively.

Now that we understand the scope of the expanded perimeter, let's get into the drone detection tech being implemented.

## Drone Detection Technology: Capabilities and Deployment

Advanced drone detection systems are being deployed to ID and track unauthorized drones. These systems use radar, acoustic sensors, and RF scanners for coverage. The goal is early warning of potential threats and airspace security.

Drone detection systems can ID and track drones from miles away. The systems have a reported accuracy rate of 95% in spotting drone threats. Data from drone detection is integrated and analyzed in real-time.

With drone detection covered, let's look at the advanced sensor networks and their role in monitoring the security perimeter.

## Advanced Sensor Networks: Monitoring and Data Privacy

Advanced sensor networks are being used within the perimeter for monitoring. These networks include video analytics, facial recognition, and chemical/biological detection. Data privacy protocols are in place to protect info and prevent misuse.

Over 500 sensors are deployed within the security perimeter. The sensor network uses AES-256 encryption for data transmission. Data retention policies limit storage of personally identifiable info to 72 hours unless a threat is detected.

Having examined the sensor networks and data privacy, let's think about the costs of deploying these new security technologies.

## Costs and Funding of New Security Technologies

Implementing these expanded security measures involves a financial investment. Costs include personnel, equipment, and infrastructure upgrades. Funding is coming from the NFL, the city, and the state.

The estimated total cost is $3.5 million. $1.8 million is for personnel, $1 million for equipment, and $700,000 for infrastructure. The NFL is kicking in $1.5 million, the city $1 million, and the state $1 million.

Now that we've addressed the costs, let's think about some counter-arguments and concerns around the use of these technologies.

## Addressing Concerns and Counter-Arguments

Concerns exist about the cost-effectiveness of the new technologies. Measures are being taken to protect data privacy and prevent misuse of the sensor networks. The potential for false alarms and tech glitches in the new systems is acknowledged.

Independent audits are conducted quarterly to assess the effectiveness of the technologies. The false alarm rate for the drone detection system is less than 1%. Public awareness campaigns are being launched to educate fans about the new security measures.
