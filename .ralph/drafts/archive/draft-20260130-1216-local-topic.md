Yo neighbors. If you tried to drive down Tasman Drive this morning to get to work or grab coffee, you probably hit a concrete wall.

The City of Santa Clara officially initiated the Phase III Hard Closure on January 28. This isn't the usual "game day traffic" we deal with during the regular season. This is a full-scale infrastructure lockdown that runs straight through February 13.

If you don't change your route right now, you are going to spend the next week staring at the bumper of a Tesla on Great America Parkway.

## The Hard Zone Reality
Here is the situation on the ground. Tasman Drive is physically barricaded from the Convention Center all the way to Great America Parkway.

I'm not talking about orange cones and a bored security guard waving you through. I'm talking about 12-foot fencing, concrete K-rails, and checkpoints staffed by private security contractors who do not care that you "just need to cut through."

Your GPS algorithms—Waze, Google Maps, Apple—are struggling to keep up. They see open pavement on the satellite, but they don't see the credentials check. I watched three cars get turned around at the Calle Del Sol checkpoint in the span of five minutes today. Don't be that guy.

## The Rideshare Geofence Trap
If you think you can just Uber your way out of this, think again. The rideshare apps have geofenced the entire stadium perimeter.

When you type "Levi's Stadium" into the app, it drops a pin at the "designated zone." For Super Bowl 60, that zone is the corner of Great America Parkway and Old Glory Lane.

Here is what the app doesn't tell you: that drop-off point is a 1.2-mile walk to the actual gates. You are getting dropped off in a parking lot, then hiking through a maze of security tents. And because every single rideshare driver is being funneled to that one intersection, the traffic jam to get into the drop-off zone is taking 40 minutes.

## The Mercado Hack
Locals know better. If you need to get close to the stadium without fighting the gridlock, you use the Mercado Hack.

Forget Tasman. Forget Great America Parkway. Tell your driver to head for **Mission College Boulevard**.

Set your destination for the **Mercado Shopping Center**. It's completely outside the "Hard Zone" and the geofence restrictions. You get dropped off right in front of the In-N-Out or the movie theater. No traffic, no checkpoints.

From there, you walk to the back of the parking lot and hop on the **San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail**. It’s a paved, flat walk that runs underneath the road closures. It dumps you right at the stadium gates in about 15 minutes. You bypass the cars, the stress, and the 1.2-mile hike from Old Glory Lane.

## The Lick Mill Warning
A lot of you are trying to get cute by taking Lick Mill Boulevard to bypass the closure. Stop it.

Lick Mill is the only north-south surface street that is technically open, and it is currently seeing a 300% increase in volume. It is a parking lot. Unless you live on Lick Mill, stay off it.

## The VTA Exception
There is exactly one vehicle allowed to cross the Hard Zone on Tasman: the VTA Light Rail.

The trains are running on a modified schedule, but they are physically moving through the barricades. If you live in Mountain View or Milpitas, park at a station and ride in. It is the only way to breach the perimeter without walking.

The lockdown is here, and it's not lifting until the Lombardi Trophy leaves town. Adjust your commute now, or get comfortable in your car.
