excerpt: "The first 15 plays of the Super Bowl are a choreographed lie. Here is the data on the 'Scripted Cliff' and why you should fade the offense in the second quarter."

Don't believe your eyes in the first quarter.

Every offensive coordinator comes into the Super Bowl with a "Scripted 15"—a sequence of plays rehearsed to perfection during the two-week break. These plays are designed to exploit specific defensive tendencies seen on film. They are run against "ghost defenses" in practice until the timing is surgical.

## The Efficiency Cliff
The data confirms that the script works. In the last five Super Bowls, the combined EPA (Expected Points Added) per play on the first two drives is **+0.28**. That is elite efficiency.

But once the script runs out? The numbers fall off a cliff.
*   **Plays 1-15:** 6.4 yards per play
*   **Plays 16-30:** 4.1 yards per play

This is the "Adjustment Gap." Once the defense sees the game plan and the offense has to call plays organically, the advantage flips.

## The "Empty Calorie" Yards
We see this pattern constantly: a team marches down the field on their opening drive, looking unstoppable. The broadcast team talks about "dominance." The live betting line swings heavily toward the offense.

This is a trap. The opening drive is not a predictor of game flow; it is a presentation of a prepared speech.

## The Betting Angle
The smart money plays the **First Quarter Over** and then hammers the **Second Quarter Under**.

When the script ends (usually early in the 2nd quarter), the offensive coordinator has to pivot to their reactive play sheet. This is where the defensive coordinators—who have now seen the offensive hand—start to dial up exotic blitzes that weren't on film.

Expect a high-flying start followed by a sluggish, punt-heavy middle frame as the teams enter the "feeling out" process for the second time.
