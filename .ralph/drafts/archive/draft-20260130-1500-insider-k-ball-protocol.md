While the players were sleeping this morning, a small team of officials was busy weighing, measuring, and tagging 120 leather footballs in a secure room deep inside Levi's Stadium.

I spoke with a league source involved in the "Ball Prep" protocol, and the level of paranoia surrounding the game balls for Super Bowl 60 is at an all-time high. The days of equipment managers massaging the leather to their quarterback's exact liking are over.

## The "K-Ball" Segregation

The biggest point of contention is the "K-Balls"—the specific balls used only for kicking plays. These are shipped directly from the Wilson factory in Ada, Ohio, in a sealed box. They are rock hard, slick, and universally hated by kickers.

"They don't let us touch them until 45 minutes before kickoff," one equipment assistant told me. "We get to rub them down with a specific brush and a damp towel, and that's it. An official stands over us with a stopwatch."

For SB60, the league has introduced a new "rotation tracking" system. If a K-Ball is used for a kickoff, it is immediately cycled out of play for the next two kicking downs to ensure wear is distributed evenly.

## The RFID Calibration

Every single ball on the field Sunday will contain a Zebra Technologies RFID tag. This isn't new, but the calibration process is.

I'm told that for the first time, the officials are testing the *balance* of the balls with the chip inside. In previous years, quarterbacks complained that the chip (located under the laces) created a slight wobble on deep throws. The new batch for SB60 has a counter-weight installed opposite the chip.

## The Chain of Custody

Once the balls are prepped today, they go into a locked cage. The Referee has the only key. When they move to the field on Sunday, they are escorted by security.

If you see a ball go into the stands after a touchdown, watch closely. A "Ball Boy" (actually a grown man employed by the league) will immediately sprint to retrieve it. If a fan keeps it, a backup ball is logged into the game with a timestamp. The league knows exactly which ball is on the field at every second. Deflategate is impossible now because the data trail is too thick.
