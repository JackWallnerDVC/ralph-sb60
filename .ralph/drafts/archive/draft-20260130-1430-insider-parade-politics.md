While the players are studying game film, the front offices are studying city maps. I can confirm that as of this morning, conditional parade permits have been filed in three different municipalities, sparking a quiet but intense political skirmish behind the scenes of Super Bowl LX.

## The Market Street Tradition vs. The Santa Clara Push

Historically, when the Bay Area host team wins, the parade rolls down Market Street in San Francisco. It’s iconic. It’s also a logistical nightmare that the NFL and local law enforcement are desperate to avoid this year.

Sources in the Mayor's office tell me there is a massive push from Santa Clara officials to keep the celebration "local."

"They want the parade on Great America Parkway," a high-level city official told me. "The argument is security. It’s easier to lock down a four-lane boulevard in Santa Clara than the financial district of San Francisco. Plus, the stadium is right there."

## The 'Ghost' Contracts

Here is the wildest part: The contracts for the float construction are already signed.

I’ve obtained a memo from a major event production company in Oakland that outlines two distinct "activation plans" for Monday morning:
1.  **Plan A (The Traditionalist):** A 2.5-mile route ending at Civic Center Plaza.
2.  **Plan B (The South Bay):** A loop around Levi's Stadium ending with a rally inside the bowl.

The team ownership is reportedly split. The business side wants the global backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge (figuratively speaking). The football operations side wants the ease of the Santa Clara bubble, where players can stay in their current hotels and avoid a 45-mile bus ride into the city.

## The Visiting Team's Contingency

Don't think the AFC champions are sleeping on this. Their advance team has already booked a "victory venue" near the Convention Center for a private post-game bash that is rumored to cost upwards of $2 million.

They aren't planning a parade in California—they’ll fly home Monday morning—but the logistics of getting 150 players, coaches, and family members from the stadium to the airport after a win is its own military operation. I’m hearing they have requested a police escort for *three* separate bus convoys to act as decoys.

The game is Sunday, but the logistics war is already in overtime.
