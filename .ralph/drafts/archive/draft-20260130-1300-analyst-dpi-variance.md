Handicapping the Super Bowl requires handicapping the third team on the field: the officials.

Unlike the regular season where crews work together weekly, the Super Bowl crew is an "all-star" assembly of the highest-graded officials at each position. This breaks the chemistry and standardizes the enforcement in ways that often defy regular season trends.

## The Crew Chief Factor

For SB60, the assigned Referee (Crew Chief), **Shawn Hochuli**, has a distinct statistical profile. In the 2025 season, his crew called **Defensive Pass Interference (DPI)** at a rate of 1.4 calls per game. The league average is 0.8.

This is not a "let them play" official. This is a "by the book" official who prioritizes the strict enforcement of impeding the receiver.

## The Back Judge Alignment

Crucially, the Back Judge assigned to this crew—the official primarily responsible for deep ball contact—ranks in the **90th percentile** for illegal contact flags.

When you combine a strict Crew Chief with a strict Back Judge, the "Zebra Variance" shifts heavily toward the offense.

## The Strategic Impact

Defenses in the Super Bowl typically play more aggressive man-coverage, relying on the physical nature of the game. However, against this specific officiating alignment, that aggression is a liability.

We project a **25% increase** in penalty yardage relative to the average of the two competing teams.

## The Play

The public often bets the "Under" on penalties, buying into the narrative that officials swallow their whistles in the big game. The data on this specific crew contradicts that.

*   **Bet:** Total Accepted Penalties OVER 10.5
*   **Bet:** First Down by Penalty OVER 3.5
*   **Lean:** Longest Play from Scrimmage OVER (aided by spot-foul DPI yardage)

Don't bet on the narrative. Bet on the tendency of the men holding the flags.
