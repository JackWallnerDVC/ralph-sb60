excerpt: "Heavy blitzing is a statistical death sentence in the modern Super Bowl era. The data proves that SB60 will be decided by 'Simulated Pressure'—the art of rushing 4 while showing 6."

If you are betting on the team with the highest blitz rate to win Super Bowl 60, you are betting against the math.

In the last decade of Super Bowls, the winning defensive coordinator has called a traditional blitz (5+ rushers) on just 18.4% of dropbacks. The losing coordinators? 31.2%.

The correlation is stark: In the modern NFL, sending the house doesn't create chaos; it creates passing lanes.

## The Rise of Simulated Pressure ("SimPress")

The metric that matters for SB60 isn't Blitz Rate; it's **Simulated Pressure Rate**.

SimPress involves crowding the line of scrimmage with 6 or 7 defenders pre-snap, threatening a "Zero Blitz," and then dropping 2 or 3 into coverage while rushing only 4.

*   **Standard 4-Man Rush EPA:** -0.04 per play.
*   **5+ Man Blitz EPA:** +0.12 per play (Advantage Offense).
*   **Simulated Pressure (4-Man) EPA:** -0.28 per play (Advantage Defense).

Why the discrepancy? It breaks the quarterback's pre-snap algorithm.

## The Processing Latency

When a QB identifies a blitz, his "Time to Throw" (TTT) clock accelerates. He throws hot. In 2025, the average "Hot Read" completion percentage was 68%.

When a QB identifies a blitz *that doesn't come*, he holds the ball for an average of 0.4 seconds longer, waiting for a window that closed because the "blitzer" dropped into the passing lane.

That 0.4 seconds is where sacks happen.

## The Levi's Stadium Factor

We must account for the surface. The Tifway 419 Bermuda at Levi's Stadium is fast but can be slick in the evening humidity.

Defensive backs in man coverage (required during heavy blitzes) are at a biomechanical disadvantage on reactive cuts. Zone defenders (enabled by SimPress) play with their eyes forward and feet under them.

## The Betting Angle

Look at the **Sack Totals** prop bets.

If the underdog's defensive coordinator relies on SimPress (check the "Rush 4" rates from the Conference Championship), take the **Over 2.5 Sacks**. If they rely on pure blitzing, take the **Under** and hammer the opponent's **Team Total Over**.

Pressure without numbers wins championships. Pressure with numbers just gets you burned.
