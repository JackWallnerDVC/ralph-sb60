Forget the playbook. The biggest fight happening right now isn't on the field—it's over pillow counts and suite upgrades at the Santa Clara Marriott.

**Sources confirm** that advance teams from three top NFC contenders have already been spotted scouting the designated NFC hotel. Why the urgency? Because for SB60, the NFC hotel is the "lucky" one.

## The Logistics Advantage

Here's the dirty little secret of Super Bowl week: **Commute times kill rhythm.**

For SB60, the NFC team gets the Santa Clara Marriott. It is literally walking distance to Levi's Stadium. You could throw a football from the penthouse to the parking lot.

The AFC team? They're slotted for downtown San Jose. That's a bus ride. In a police escort, it's 15 minutes. But if there's a hiccup on Highway 101? It's a variable no head coach wants to deal with.

## The 49ers Complication

Here is the whisper keeping league officials up at night: **What if the 49ers make it?**

If San Francisco wins the NFC, they are the "host" team *and* the NFC representative. Usually, the host team stays in their own beds if the game is local. But the NFL loves the "bubble" concept—keeping teams isolated.

"We're preparing for a standoff," a league source texted me this morning. "If San Francisco wins the NFC, they aren't going to want to pack bags just to sleep in a hotel two miles down the road from their houses. But the league wants control."

## The Curfew Clause

I'm also hearing about a strict "Curfew Clause" being added to the hotel contracts this year. Security perimeters are being doubled around the pools. No unauthorized guests after 10 PM, not even family.

The game is won on the field. But the mental game? That's being won at the check-in desk right now.
