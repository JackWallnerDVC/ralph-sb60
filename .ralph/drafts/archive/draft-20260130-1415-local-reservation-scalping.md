If you are just now thinking about where to eat dinner on Saturday night before the Super Bowl, I have bad news: You aren't eating.

At least, not without paying a "table tax" that rivals the cost of a nosebleed seat.

## The Bot Invasion

I've worked in Bay Area hospitality for 15 years. I have never seen it like this. Usually, we hold back 20% of tables for walk-ins and VIPs. For SB60, the owners panicked and opened everything to the apps (Resy, OpenTable, Tock) months ago.

That was a mistake.

Starting in December, automated scripts—the same kind used to snatch up PS5s and concert tickets—hit the reservation systems for every major steakhouse and Italian spot in Santa Clara and San Jose.

**Birk's**, **Bourbon Steak**, **Il Fornaio**—they were wiped clean in milliseconds.

## The Secondary Market

Where did the tables go? They are on the secondary market.

Yes, there is a black market for dinner. Websites like *Appointment Trader* and private Telegram channels are currently listing:

*   **Bourbon Steak (Levi's Stadium):** Saturday, 7:00 PM (4 ppl) — **$850** (Reservation only, food not included).
*   **Birk's (Santa Clara):** Saturday, 6:30 PM (2 ppl) — **$300**.
*   **Mastro's (San Jose):** Friday, 8:00 PM (6 ppl) — **$1,200**.

I spoke to a GM at a spot on Great America Parkway who told me, "We have people showing up with screenshots of reservations they bought from a guy on Reddit, and the name in our system is 'John Smith' for the 50th time. It's a nightmare."

## The "Ghost" Tables

The worst part? Some of these reservations are fake. Scammers are selling "confirmed" slots that don't exist. You pay $200 via Venmo, show up at the host stand, and get laughed out of the lobby.

## The Local Fix

Do not pay for a reservation. It encourages the bots, and you might get scammed. Here is how you actually eat this weekend:

1.  **The 4 PM Special:** The bots target the 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM window. If you are willing to eat at 4:15 PM, you can often walk right in.
2.  **The Bar Hawk:** Most restaurants do not reserve bar seats. Go early, stand behind a couple that looks like they are finishing dessert, and be polite.
3.  **Get Out of the Zone:** The "Blast Radius" for the bots is about 10 miles around the stadium. If you take a 20-minute Uber to **Campbell** or **Los Gatos**, you can find incredible food without the Super Bowl surcharge.

Or, just come find me at a dive bar. The beer is cold, the hot dogs are $5, and nobody needs a reservation.
