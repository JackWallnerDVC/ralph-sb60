You might think being next to the stadium means you're in the center of the action. Wrong. You're in a fortress. And fortresses don't have DoorDash.

Starting Thursday at 6:00 AM, the "Soft Perimeter" turns the blocks around Levi's Stadium into a delivery dead zone. Drivers without Vehicle Access Passes (VAPs) get turned away at the checkpoints on Great America Parkway, Tasman Drive, and Lafayette Street.

If you are staying at the Hilton, the Hyatt, or living in the apartments on the north side of Tasman, you have two choices: pay $30 for a hotel burger or walk to the edge.

## Santa Clara Square: The Safe Haven

This is your best play. Santa Clara Square sits right at Bowers and Scott Blvd, exactly one block south of the hard security checkpoint. It is the closest you can get to the stadium with a normal car without hitting a police barricade.

The garages here are still accessible to the public. This is the sweet spot for anyone who wants to eat well before entering the chaos.

**Il Fornaio:** This is where you go for the pre-game carb load. It is going to be packed with NFL suits and media types, but the bar area usually turns over fast. The bread alone is worth the stop before you face the $18 pretzels inside the gates.

**Puesto:** If you need tacos and a margarita before facing the security lines, this is the spot. The patio is huge, which matters when every indoor seat is taken.

**The Strategy:** Park in the garage here early. Eat a real meal. Then walk the 20 minutes down the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail to the stadium. You skip the parking lot nightmare, you save on parking fees, and you enter on a full stomach.

## Rivermark Village: The North Side Escape

If you are coming from the north or staying near the Oracle campus, Rivermark is the only game in town. It sits on Montague Expressway, just outside the northern edge of the security zone.

**Fleming's:** This is the post-game spot. When the game ends, Tasman Drive is a parking lot. Don't try to drive. Walk north to Rivermark. The bar at Fleming's is where the locals wait out the traffic. You can watch the post-game coverage on TV while everyone else is staring at brake lights.

**Safeway:** This sounds basic, but listen to me. The stores inside the perimeter—like the Target on Coleman—get stripped bare by the production crews and security staff. The Rivermark Safeway is just outside the zone, so the trucks can still restock it. If you need water, beer, or chips for your hotel room, go here.

## The Mercado Survival Station

If you just need a burger, head to the Mercado center on Mission College Blvd. This is south of the stadium, past the AMC theater.

**In-N-Out:** It’s California. It’s a staple. The line will wrap around the building, but it moves. This is also the drop-off point for the "Creek Trail Backdoor" I told you about. Grab a Double-Double, walk to the trail entrance behind the movie theater, and hike it in.

## The Delivery Warning

I cannot stress this enough: Do not open your delivery apps if you are inside the perimeter. The app will let you order. The driver will pick up the food. And then the driver will call you from a police barricade a mile away saying they can't get in.

The checkpoints at Agnew Road and Lafayette are strict. Unless that Prius has a VAP hangtag, it isn't getting through. You will end up walking that mile to pick up your cold pizza.

Eat at the edge. Walk in. Survive the week.
