I've been getting texts all week asking the same question: "Tony, can I just Uber to the stadium?"

The short answer: No.
The long answer: Only if you enjoy walking two miles and paying $150 for the privilege.

## The "Geofence" Reality

For Super Bowl 60, the SCPD (Santa Clara Police Department) and the NFL have set up a strict vehicle exclusion zone. This isn't like a regular 49ers Sunday.

The rideshare "geofence"—the digital barrier where the app literally won't let a driver accept a pickup or drop-off—extends from **Lawrence Expressway to the west** and **Lafayette Street to the east**.

If you type "Levi's Stadium" into Lyft on Sunday, it will route you to **Red Lot 1**. That sounds close, but due to security checkpoints and pedestrian funneling, it is a **1.4-mile walk** from the drop-off point to the actual stadium gates.

## The Surge Math

I talked to a few drivers who work the Levi's circuit. They are planning to turn their apps *off* until the surge hits 4.0x.

During the NFC Championship game, a ride from Union Square (SF) to Santa Clara cost $180 one way. For the Super Bowl, estimates are hitting **$350-$400**. And that's if you can get a signal. With 70,000 people hitting the towers at once, the apps crash. Hard.

## The Local Workaround

If you absolutely refuse to take the VTA Light Rail (which, by the way, is the only vehicle allowed to drop you at the front door), here is the play:

Don't set your destination to the stadium. Set it to **Lick Mill Blvd & Tasman Dr**.

It's just outside the hard perimeter. You'll still have to walk about 20 minutes, but you avoid the "Red Lot 1" bottleneck where thousands of confused tourists are trying to find their Prius.

Better yet? Take the Capitol Corridor train to the **Great America station**. It has bathrooms, it serves beer, and it doesn't get stuck in traffic on the 101.

Save the Uber money for the $18 beers inside.
