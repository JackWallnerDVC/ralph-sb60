Yo neighbors. The City of Santa Clara stopped being polite about the traffic yesterday.

If you drove down Tasman Drive this morning thinking you could cut through to Great America Parkway, you probably ended up staring at a concrete barrier and a very bored police officer pointing you toward a U-turn.

The "Phase II & III Road Closures" are officially live as of January 28, and they aren't lifting until February 13. This isn't just a game-day inconvenience. This is a two-week infrastructure lockdown that turns the north side of Santa Clara into a maze.

## The Tasman Dead Zone
Here is the reality on the ground: Tasman Drive is closed to all non-credentialed traffic from the Convention Center to Great America Parkway.

That means the standard Uber drop-off point right in front of the stadium? Gone.
The quick right turn into the Yellow Lot? Gone.
The "I'll just drop you at the corner" strategy? That corner is now a checkpoint.

If you try to follow your GPS, it’s going to route you into a "Vehicle Detour" loop that dumps you onto Lafayette Street, which is already backed up to Highway 237. I watched a guy in a Tesla spend 20 minutes trying to move three blocks this morning. Don't be that guy.

## The VTA Choke Point
The VTA Light Rail is still running, but the Great America station has turned into a security funnel. Because the station is technically *inside* the hard perimeter, getting off the train means you are immediately herded into a screening queue.

On a normal Sunday, this takes ten minutes. With the Super Bowl security overlay—magneometers, bag searches, and credential checks—that queue is going to back up onto the platform. If you take the train, get off at the Lick Mill station and walk the extra half-mile. You will beat the crowd standing in line at the main gate.

## The Mercado Hack
Here is the play if you need to get close to the stadium without a parking pass.

Ignore the "Stadium Drop-Off" signs. They send you to a designated lot that is a 25-minute walk from the gates. Instead, have your rideshare drop you at the **Mercado Shopping Center** on Mission College Blvd.

Grab a burger at In-N-Out or a coffee at Starbucks. Then, walk behind the AMC theater and hop on the **San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail**.

This trail runs north, right underneath the closed roads. It bypasses the Tasman checkpoint entirely. You walk along the creek, enjoy the silence, and pop out right at Gate C. While everyone else is arguing with a traffic cop on Great America Parkway, you are strolling in the back door.

## The Food Desert Warning
One last heads-up: The "Clean Zone" rules mean delivery drivers are getting turned away at the perimeter checkpoints. If you work in one of the office parks on Tasman that is inside the zone, do not order DoorDash for lunch. The driver cannot get to you.

Pack a lunch, or be prepared to walk out to the perimeter to meet them. The days of convenient delivery are suspended until the Lombardi Trophy leaves town.
