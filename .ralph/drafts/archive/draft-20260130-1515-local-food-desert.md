Yo,

If you have been to a Super Bowl in New Orleans, Miami, or Las Vegas, you are used to a certain rhythm: The game ends, you spill out into the streets, and the party (and the food) goes until 4:00 AM.

You need to reset your expectations for Super Bowl 60. Levi's Stadium is located in the middle of a tech office park. It is designed for software engineers grabbing a quick lunch, not for 70,000 fans looking for dinner at midnight.

## The 9:30 PM Cliff
Here is the reality on the ground: Most restaurants within walking distance of the stadium—the chains on Great America Parkway—are either bought out for private parties or they close their kitchens by 10:00 PM.

I am not exaggerating. You will walk out of the stadium buzzing from the game, walk three blocks, and find dark windows. The "entertainment district" promised in the brochures is mostly corporate event spaces that require a laminate to enter.

## The In-N-Out Trap
Every out-of-towner has the same backup plan: "We'll just hit the In-N-Out on Mission College Blvd."

Do not do this.

That specific In-N-Out is the closest fast food to the stadium. On a regular Sunday, the line wraps around the block. On Super Bowl Sunday, the drive-thru line will effectively merge with the post-game traffic jam. I have seen people wait two hours for a Double-Double. It is not worth it.

## The El Camino Real Solution
If you want to eat late, you have to leave the "Stadium Zone." You need to head south to **El Camino Real** in Santa Clara/Sunnyvale.

This is the unofficial Koreatown of the South Bay. It is the only stretch where you will find kitchens firing past midnight. Look for the Tofu Houses or Korean BBQ spots near the Lawrence Expressway intersection. They are used to the late-night crowd, they move fast, and they won't charge you "Event Pricing" for a bowl of stew.

## The San Jose Pivot
Your other option is to jump on the VTA Light Rail south to downtown San Jose. **San Pedro Square Market** is keeping extended hours for the weekend, and there are actual bars that serve food late. It takes 30 minutes to get there, but you will actually get fed.

Just don't wander around Tasman Drive hoping to stumble upon a slice of pizza. You will only find locked doors and security guards.
