If you live within two miles of Levi's Stadium and thought you heard a distorted mix of jet engines and heavy bass at 11:00 PM last night, you weren't dreaming. And no, that wasn't the actual halftime performance.

Sources inside the production compound in the Red Lot tell me the league has deployed "Audio Camouflage" protocols for Super Bowl LX rehearsals. This is a direct response to last year's leaks, where fans recorded the entire dress rehearsal from a nearby parking garage and uploaded it to TikTok before kickoff.

## The Wall of Sound

Here is how it works. The production team has rigged directional speaker arrays on the stadium rim, facing *outward*. During sensitive parts of the rehearsal—specifically the surprise guest reveal and the finale—these speakers blast "Pink Noise" and randomized bass tracks.

"It’s designed to scramble the audio for anyone recording on a phone outside the bowl," a production source told me this morning. "If you're in the parking lot, you hear chaos. If you're inside the stadium, you hear the mix perfectly."

## The Setlist Lockdown

The paranoia is at an all-time high. I'm hearing that even the backup dancers haven't been given the full audio files for the final transition. They are rehearsing to click tracks and count-ins.

The "Talent" (NFL code for the headliner) arrived on site via a decoy motorcade at 1:00 AM. Security cleared the entire west concourse—even credentialed stadium staff were held in the tunnels for 20 minutes while the entourage moved to the dressing rooms.

## The Drone Shield

It’s not just audio. The FAA's Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) usually covers game day, but the NFL has paid for private "Drone Shield" technology to be active during these night rehearsals.

I watched security intercept a hobbyist drone operator near the San Tomas Aquino Creek trail yesterday afternoon. They aren't messing around. If you're trying to get a sneak peek of the stage setup, save your battery. The league has this place locked down tighter than the Pentagon.
