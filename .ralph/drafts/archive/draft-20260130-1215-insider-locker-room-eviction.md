excerpt: "It is the ultimate indignity. Despite playing Super Bowl 60 in their own stadium, NFL rules mandate that the 49ers vacate their home locker room for the AFC Champions. Here is the logistical nightmare unfolding in the tunnels."

Home field advantage is supposed to mean sleeping in your own bed and dressing in your own locker. For the San Francisco 49ers, only one of those is true.

Sources inside the Levi's Stadium operations team confirmed to me this morning that the NFL is enforcing the strict "Conference Rotation" policy for Super Bowl 60.

## The Even-Year Curse

The rule is binary:
*   **Odd Numbered Super Bowls:** NFC is the "Home" team.
*   **Even Numbered Super Bowls (SB60):** AFC is the "Home" team.

Because SB60 is an even year, the AFC Champion (potentially the Chiefs or Ravens) is the designated Home Team. By league bylaws, the Home Team is awarded the host stadium's primary locker room.

## The Move-Out

This isn't just about swapping signs. I'm told the 49ers equipment staff has been given a deadline of **Tuesday, February 3rd at 12:00 PM** to completely vacate the 49ers' state-of-the-art home facility.

"We have to move everything," one equipment assistant told me. "The hydrotherapy tubs, the custom nutrition stations, the players' personal items. We are literally packing up our house so the enemy can move in for a week."

## The Visitor Experience

Where are the 49ers going? They will be relegated to the **Visitor's Locker Room** on the west side of the stadium.

While Levi's Stadium has a better-than-average visitor suite, it lacks the square footage, the custom sauna facilities, and the dedicated medical wing of the home side.

## The Psychological Warfare

The AFC representative knows exactly what they are doing. I'm hearing the AFC equipment managers have already requested that the 49ers' "Gold Rush" branding in the tunnel be covered with neutral Super Bowl 60 signage.

Imagine walking into your own stadium, turning left instead of right, and seeing the Chiefs' gear hanging in your locker. That is the reality facing the 49ers next Sunday.
