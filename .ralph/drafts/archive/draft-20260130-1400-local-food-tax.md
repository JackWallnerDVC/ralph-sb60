excerpt: "Restaurants near Levi's Stadium are swapping out their menus for 'Event Pricing' this week. Here is how to spot the gouge and where the locals are actually eating."

I walked into a pub on Great America Parkway yesterday—a place I've been going to for five years. The laminated menus were gone. In their place were single sheets of paper titled "Championship Week Menu."

The burger that was $16 last week is now **$28**. The domestic draft beer is **$14**.

Welcome to the "Super Bowl Tax."

## The "Event Menu" Scam

This happens every time a major event hits Levi's, but for SB60, the gouging is hitting record highs.

Here is the reality: Restaurants within the "Security Zone" (roughly a 1.5-mile radius of the stadium) know you are trapped. Uber surge pricing is hovering around 3x, so paying $12 extra for a burger feels cheaper than paying $50 to ride to San Jose.

They aren't just raising prices; they are shrinking portions. That "Championship Nachos" platter? It's 30% smaller than the regular order to speed up table turnover.

## The Safe Zones

If you want to eat like a human and not an ATM, you need to get outside the blast radius. You don't need to go far, you just need to know where the "Event Pricing" boundary ends.

### 1. The El Camino Real Corridor (2 Miles South)
Head south to El Camino Real. It’s just outside the primary hotel block.
*   **Stan's Donuts:** Still selling the best glazed donut in the world for regular price. No "Super Bowl Sprinkles" markup.
*   **Korea Town (El Camino & Lawrence):** The BBQ spots here are too busy with locals to care about the Super Bowl crowd. You can get a full galbi set for the price of one appetizer near the stadium.

### 2. The "Tech Campus" Cafeterias
This is a weird one, but hear me out. Several of the office parks off 237 have public-facing food courts that cater to engineers, not tourists. They operate on fixed contracts. The prices literally cannot change.
*   **@First Shopping Center:** It's technically North San Jose, but it's a 5-minute tram ride. Standard pricing on tacos and banh mi.

## The Tailgate Rule

If you are planning to eat inside the stadium perimeter on gameday, bring cash.

The credit card networks at Levi's get hammered when 70,000 people try to buy hot dogs at halftime. When the terminals lag, the lines stall. Cash is king. It's faster, and vendors will sometimes "forget" the tax if you have exact change.

Don't pay $28 for a burger. Hop on a scooter, ride 10 minutes south, and eat better for half the price.
