The biggest threat to the Super Bowl 60 halftime show isn't a wardrobe malfunction or a power outage. It’s the Santa Clara City Council.

## The Hard Stop

I’ve obtained a memo circulated among the production crew regarding Thursday night’s full dress rehearsal. It contains a directive in bold red text: **"AUDIO HARD STOP AT 22:00 PST."**

Santa Clara’s noise ordinance is legendary in the entertainment industry. It has cost the 49ers millions in fines and legal fees over the years. For SB60, the NFL negotiated a specific waiver, but it is not a blank check.

## The "Dry Run" Contingency

Sources inside the production truck tell me there is a specific contingency plan if technical delays push the rehearsal past 10:00 PM.

"If we aren't done by 9:55, we go dark," one audio engineer told me. "We switch to 'Dry Mode.' The artists stay on stage, the choreography continues, but the stadium PA is killed. The performers rely 100% on their in-ear monitors (IEMs)."

This creates a bizarre scene: A silent stadium with hundreds of dancers moving in unison to music only they can hear, while pyrotechnics (which have a separate, stricter permit window) are simulated with LED strobes.

## The Fine vs. The Injunction

Why does the NFL care? The fines—usually around $1,000 per incident—are a rounding error for the league.

"It's not the money," a league source admitted. "It's the injunction risk. If we flagrantly violate the Thursday permit, the city has the theoretical power to pull the pyrotechnics permit for Sunday. We aren't testing them."

Residents in the nearby Tasman Drive neighborhoods have been issued noise complaint hotlines specifically for this week. The NFL isn't just managing a show; they are managing a neighborhood watch.
