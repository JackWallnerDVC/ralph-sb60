excerpt: "Kickoff will be sunny and 65°F. By the time the fourth quarter starts, the temperature will have plummeted 15 degrees. Here is the data on how that impacts the passing game."

Everyone discusses the "Levi's Stadium Sun" blinding the east sideline. But for Super Bowl 60, the most significant atmospheric factor isn't the light—it's the temperature gradient.

Santa Clara has a specific microclimate. Unlike a dome or a humid East Coast city, the heat here is entirely solar-driven. Once the sun drops behind the stadium rim (approx. 4:45 PM PT in February), the temperature doesn't glide down; it crashes.

## The Data: The 5:00 PM Drop
Historical weather data for Santa Clara in early February shows a consistent pattern:
*   **3:30 PM (Kickoff):** 64°F, 45% humidity.
*   **5:30 PM (Halftime):** 56°F, humidity rising.
*   **7:00 PM (4th Quarter):** 49°F, 75% humidity.

We are looking at a **15-degree swing** during the game window.

## The Physics of the Football
This drop impacts the ball's behavior via the Ideal Gas Law ($PV=nRT$).
*   **Pressure Drop:** A 15-degree drop in ambient temperature results in a measurable decrease in internal air pressure (PSI). While not "Deflategate" levels, the ball becomes slightly softer.
*   **Leather Texture:** The bigger issue is the humidity spike combined with the cooling leather. The ball becomes slicker.
*   **Kicking Distance:** Cold air is denser. Our models suggest a 55-yard field goal attempt in the 1st quarter has the aerodynamic equivalent of a 58-yard attempt in the 4th quarter.

## The Betting Angle: The "Under" Trend
In late-season games at Levi's Stadium starting in the afternoon and ending at night, 2nd half scoring drops by an average of **14%** compared to the 1st half, adjusting for game script.

**The Takeaway:** If the game is a shootout in the first half, do not assume the pace will hold. The air gets heavy, the ball gets slick, and the deep passing game suffers. Live bettors should look for the "Under" on 2nd half totals if they open inflated based on 1st half production.
