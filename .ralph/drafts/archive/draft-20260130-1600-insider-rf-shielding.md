If you are trying to text a player during their morning install meeting this week, don't bother. The message won't go through.

Sources at both the Marriott Santa Clara and the Hilton San Jose confirm that the participating teams have taken extreme measures to secure their game-planning sessions.

## The Copper Curtain

I’m told that earlier this week, private security contractors installed **RF (Radio Frequency) shielding** in the main ballrooms designated for team meetings.

Essentially, they have turned these rooms into temporary Faraday cages.

"It's military-grade stuff," one team logistics coordinator told me. "We lined the walls with conductive mesh and put blockers on the windows. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out."

## The Paranoia Level

Why the extreme measures? Paranoia about digital espionage is at an all-time high.

In previous years, teams worried about someone leaving a playbook in a bar. Now, the threat vector is remote.
*   **Audio Bugs:** Wireless listening devices are easily defeated by RF blocking.
*   **Drone Surveillance:** There is a genuine fear that high-fidelity cameras on drones could zoom in on whiteboards through hotel windows.

## The Player Fallout

The players, naturally, are annoyed.

"We have to leave our phones in a bucket outside the door like we're in high school," one veteran defensive back texted me (after he left the room). "And even if you sneak it in, you have 'No Service' the whole time. You can't even download the film updates until you get back to your room."

The league office has no official policy against teams fortifying their own hotels, provided they pay for the modifications. And with the stakes this high, a $50,000 bill for copper mesh is a rounding error.
