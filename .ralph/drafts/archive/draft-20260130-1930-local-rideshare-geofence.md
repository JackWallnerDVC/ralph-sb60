excerpt: "Thinking of calling an Uber from the stadium gate? Think again. The SB60 digital geofence blocks ride requests within a 1.5-mile radius. Here is the walk you need to make to get a signal."

Listen up, because this is going to save you an hour of staring at your phone in frustration.

When the clock hits 0:00 on Sunday, 65,000 people are going to try to open Uber and Lyft at the exact same time. But it’s not just about surge pricing; it’s about the **Geofence**.

## The Blackout Zone
For Super Bowl 60, the City of Santa Clara and the NFL have activated a strict digital perimeter. If your GPS pin drops anywhere within the stadium footprint or the immediate parking lots, the app will not let you request a ride. It will force you to navigate to the "Designated Rideshare Zone."

## The Red Lot 7 Trap
The official zone is **Red Lot 7**. On the map, it looks close. In reality, it is a 1.2-mile walk from the main gates, mostly over gravel and temporary pedestrian bridges.

Once you get there, you enter a queue system that looks like airport security. You don't get *your* driver; you get a PIN code and hop into the first available car. Last time I tested this during a playoff game, the wait was 90 minutes.

## The Mercado Hack
Here is the local move. Do not go to Red Lot 7.

Instead, exit the stadium to the South (Gate F) and walk down the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail (yes, the one I told you about earlier) towards **Mission College Blvd**.

Head for the **Mercado Shopping Center** (where the AMC theater is). It is exactly 1.6 miles from the stadium, which puts it *just* outside the geofence.
1.  Grab a slice at the pizza place or a drink at the bar while you wait.
2.  Request your ride from the parking lot.
3.  The drivers love this spot because they can access it from Highway 101 without getting stuck in the Great America Parkway gridlock.

Walk 25 minutes to save 90. That’s the math.
