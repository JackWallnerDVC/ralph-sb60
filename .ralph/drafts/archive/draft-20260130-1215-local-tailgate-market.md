If you thought getting a seat inside Levi's was tough, try getting a spot for your grill.

The official parking passes for Super Bowl 60 sold out in exactly four minutes during the initial release last month. Now, the secondary market for prime asphalt is getting absolutely stupid.

## Blue Lot 1: The Gold Standard

Blue Lot 1 is the holy grail. It’s right next to the stadium, it allows open flames (a rarity in California stadium lots), and it’s where the die-hards congregate.

Face value for a standard vehicle pass was $150.
As of this morning, verified resale on StubHub is averaging **$850**.

I talked to a buddy of mine, "Big Sal," who runs a tailgate crew out of San Jose. He just sold his two spots for $1,800 cash to a corporate group from New York. "I can watch the game at the bar for that price," he told me. "The asphalt is worth more than the car parked on it."

## The PDF Trap

Here is the warning you need to hear: **Do not buy printed passes off Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.**

The SB60 parking passes are fully digital this year. They are dynamic QR codes that refresh every 15 seconds within the app. If someone is trying to sell you a PDF or a screenshot of a pass, they are scamming you.

I've already heard of three groups of fans who bought "printed" Blue Lot passes for $500 a pop, only to find out they bought a piece of paper worth zero.

## The "Local" Alternative

If you don't want to drop a grand to park, head to the **Great America Amtrak lot**. It’s a bit of a hike (about 15 minutes walking), but the tailgating scene there is looser, the passes are hovering around $200, and honestly, the vibe is more authentic.

Just make sure you pack a wagon for your cooler. That walk feels a lot longer on the way back.
