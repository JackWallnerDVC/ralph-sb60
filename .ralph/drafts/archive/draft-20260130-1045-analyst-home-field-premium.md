The San Francisco 49ers have become the third team in NFL history to host a Super Bowl in their own building, following the 2020 Buccaneers and the 2021 Rams.

The betting markets are currently wrestling with how to price this. Standard NFL Home Field Advantage (HFA) has historically been valued at 3 points, though modern analytics (since 2019) suggest it has eroded to approximately 1.4 to 1.8 points.

For Super Bowl 60, the "Home" tag is misleading.

### The Corporate Crowd Dilution
In a standard Week 12 game at Levi's Stadium, the crowd noise impact (decibels disrupting opposing offensive comms) accounts for roughly 60% of the HFA variable.

That variable is non-existent on Sunday.
*   **Ticket Allocation:** The participating teams only receive 35% of the total ticket inventory combined.
*   **Corporate Block:** The NFL controls 25% for sponsors and partners.
*   **Secondary Market:** With average ticket prices hovering around $8,500, the demographic shifts from "die-hard local" to "wealthy tourist."

We saw this in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Despite being a Rams home game, the crowd noise advantage was negligible compared to a regular season game.

### The Logistical Alpha
However, the market is ignoring the *operational* HFA. This is where the 49ers hold a statistical edge that isn't priced into the spread.

1.  **Circadian Rhythm:** The 49ers are staying in their own beds (or local team hotels they use regularly). The AFC opponent is dealing with a 3-hour time zone shift and unfamiliar facilities.
2.  **Turf Familiarity:** Levi's Stadium uses a specific Bermuda Bandera grass blend. It plays fast but can be slippery in the evening humidity. The 49ers have played 9 games on this specific surface this season. Data from SB57 (State Farm Stadium) showed that players unfamiliar with the surface slipped on 14% of dropbacks in the first half.
3.  **Wind Tunnel Knowledge:** As noted in local weather reports, the wind shear at the North end of the stadium is unique. The 49ers quarterback has 20+ starts throwing into that wind; the AFC quarterback has zero.

### The Verdict
If you are betting the spread based on "Home Field" crowd energy, you are burning money. The value lies in the **First Quarter** and **First Half** lines.

The "Home" team in this specific scenario settles in faster. The logistical comfort translates to execution speed in the first 15 minutes while the opponent adjusts to the turf and the lighting.

**Recommendation:** Look for value on 49ers 1Q spread if it stays under -0.5.
