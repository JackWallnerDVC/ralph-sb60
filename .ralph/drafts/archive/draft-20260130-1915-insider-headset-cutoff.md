excerpt: "At exactly 15 seconds on the play clock, the quarterback's helmet goes silent. It's not a glitch; it's the 'Kill Switch.' Here is the tech protocol that isolates the QB."

Watch the quarterback's hands. If you see him suddenly clap over his earholes or frantically wave to the sideline with 12 seconds on the play clock, he's not signaling a motion. He's panicking because the "Wall" just went up.

## The Kill Switch
Per NFL rules, the radio communication between the coach and the quarterback (and the defensive signal-caller) must be cut off when the play clock hits 15 seconds, or when the ball is snapped—whichever comes first.

For Super Bowl 60, this isn't handled by a guy with a stopwatch. It's controlled by the **GSC (Game Services Coordinator)** system, a proprietary rig located in the press box. The system is hardwired into the stadium's play clock data feed. As soon as the integer "15" registers on the official clock data, the encryption key for the helmet receiver is temporarily suspended.

## The "Green Dot" Encryption
Only two players on the field have active receivers: the offensive player with the green dot on his helmet (usually the QB) and the defensive player with the green dot (usually the middle linebacker).

I'm told that for SB60, the NFL has issued new, rolling encryption keys for these headsets. In the past, teams were paranoid about frequency sniffing. Now, the audio is digital, encrypted, and hops frequencies continuously.

## The "Belt Pack" Backup
If the automated system fails—which happened twice during the regular season—a league official known as the **Frequency Coordinator** (wearing a teal vest on the sideline) has a manual override "kill switch" on their belt pack.

If the coach keeps talking past 15 seconds, the official kills the feed manually. If a team is caught trying to bypass the cutoff (using a secondary channel), it's an immediate unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and a massive fine.

## The Silence
Once that line goes dead, the QB is on his own. He can't hear the coordinator changing the protection. He can't hear the warning about the blitz. The crowd noise at Levi's is expected to hit 115 decibels. The 15-second cutoff is the moment the game shifts from a chess match to a street fight.
