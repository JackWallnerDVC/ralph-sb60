The Secret Service has quietly assumed 'Gold Level' control over the field access tunnels, overriding Santa Clara PD's credentialing list. I'm hearing team security directors are furious because their standard all-access passes are being flagged at checkpoints, requiring a secondary biometric scan that wasn't in the briefing packet.",

Operations managers are frantically negotiating a 'soft entry' window at 3 AM to get tons of premium club seafood inside. If the perimeter doesn't open, the suites at Levi's might be facing a limited menu on Sunday.",

Because he wasn't on the interview circuit, Kubiak spent the bye week installing a specific set of red-zone plays players are calling 'The Vault.' These are formations that haven't appeared on tape all season, specifically designed to exploit the defensive tendencies of potential Super Bowl opponents.",
