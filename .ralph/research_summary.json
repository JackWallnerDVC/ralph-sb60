I'm hearing the offensive staff has been building a specific 'Super Bowl Only' install since Week 14, knowing the continuity was safe. Players have been drilling these un-scouted looks in closed sessions. This isn't a standard game plan; it's a playbook within a playbook that only exists because the coordinator wasn't interviewing elsewhere.",
