Okay, I will analyze .ralph/trends.json and .ralph/real_intel.json to create    
.ralph/analysis_1_topics.json containing the top 5 trending topics, their       
momentum (rising/falling), and the best-fitting persona for each.               

Here's the breakdown of how I'll determine the content:                         

 1 Trending Topics: Extract the trends from .ralph/trends.json.                 
 2 Momentum: Analyze the real_intel.json to see if there are recent articles    
   related to each trend. More recent and numerous articles indicate rising     
   momentum; fewer or older articles suggest falling momentum.                  
 3 Persona Fit: Match each topic to the persona (from personas.json which you   
   provided earlier) whose topics best align with the trend.                    
 4 Output: Create the .ralph/analysis_1_topics.json file with the specified     
   format.                                                                      

Here's the proposed content for .ralph/analysis_1_topics.json:

Based on the analysis_1_topics.json file, the top topics for the analyst persona
are related to the NFL Playoff picture, potential SB60 matchups, and the San
